      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. The choroid plexus (ChP), serving as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier, plays essential roles in immune response to stress and brain homeostasis. However, the cellular and molecular contributions of the ChP to AD progression remain inadequately understood. To elucidate the molecular abnormalities during the early stages of AD, we acquired single-cell transcription profiling of ChP from APP/PS1 mice with early-stage of A\u03b2 pathology and litter-mate controls. The transcriptional alterations that occurred in each cell type were identified by differentially expressed genes, cell-cell communications and pseudotemporal trajectory analysis. The findings were subsequently validated by a series of in situ and in vitro assays. We constructed a comprehensive atlas of ChP at single-cell resolution and identified six major cell types and immune subclusters in male mice. The majority of dysregulated genes were found in the epithelial cells of APP/PS1 mice in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice, and most of these genes belonged to down-regulated module involved in mitochondrial respirasome assembly, cilium organization, and barrier integrity. The disruption of the epithelial barrier resulted in the downregulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) secretion in APP/PS1 mice, leading to macrophage activation and increased phagocytosis of A\u03b2. Concurrently, ligands (e.g., APOE) secreted by macrophages and other ChP cells facilitated the entry of lipids into ependymal cells, leading to lipid accumulation and the activation of microglia in the brain parenchyma in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT controls. Taken together, these data profiled early transcriptional and cellular abnormalities of ChP within an AD mouse model, providing novel insights of cerebral vasculature into the pathobiology of AD.",

      "abstract": "The growing prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is a consequence of population aging and demands urgent treatment strategies. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the contribution of oxidative stress and insulin resistance in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, current therapeutic approaches to treat oxidative stress and insulin resistance in this age-related neurodegenerative disease will be discussed. AD is the most prevalent form of neurodegenerative disease and is marked at early stages by oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Results indicate that insulin resistance may be central in generating oxidative stress and exacerbating AD hallmarks. In turn, insulin resistance can be influenced by other factors, including amyloid beta (A\u03b2), impaired biliverdin-reductase A (BVR-A) activity, and the gut microbiota. Defective insulin signaling in the brain comes with consequences ranging from declined cognitive functions, impaired autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, hyperphosphorylation of Tau, and increased A\u03b2 production. Multiple therapeutic approaches that target oxidative stress or brain insulin resistance, such as antioxidant supplementation and anti-diabetic drugs, have mostly been inconclusive, except for intranasal insulin. Positive results have been obtained in clinical trials using nasal delivery devices to administer insulin; however, results are inconsistent across studies likely due to inconsistencies in the delivery method. Future investigations should focus on investigating the molecular link between oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and AD to address current knowledge gaps. Moreover, more focus should be given to optimizing the reliability and efficacy of nasal delivery devices before considering such an approach viable to treat neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Astrocytic HSP60 Deletion Induced Astrocyte Senescence and Inhibited Neuroregeneration via Modulating the S1P/Truncated-BDNF Pathway.",
      "abstract": "Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60) plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function in astrocytes and has a significant impact on central nervous system (CNS) health. However, how HSP60 regulates the mitochondrial function of astrocytes to inhibit neuroregeneration remains unknown. In this study, we generated astrocyte-specific HSP60 knockout male mice to investigate the consequences of HSP60 deficiency. Firstly, our results confirmed that HSP60 deficiency caused abnormal expression of mitochondrial function-related genes, causing significant mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggered cellular senescence in astrocytes. Moreover, the alterations of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) expression suggested a disruption in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the increased levels of site-1 protease (S1P), truncated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (truncated-BDNF), and synaptophysin indicate synaptic structural and functional impairments. Expectedly, our findings demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence in astrocytes, leading to altered expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the cortex, as well as reduced neuronal numbers and neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus after the deletion of HSP60 in astrocytes of the male mice. Notably, Urolithin A (UA) and the S1P inhibitor,\u00a0PF429242, were found to alleviate astrocyte senescence and promote neuronal regeneration by inhibiting truncated BDNF expression. In conclusion, our study revealed that HSP60 deficiency in astrocytes induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence via the S1P/truncated-BDNF pathway, resulting in disrupted neurotransmitter receptor expression, synaptic protein alterations, and impaired neuroregeneration. These insights underscored the importance of HSP60 in CNS health and provided promising avenues for developing treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "Deficiency in the short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (ECHS1) gene causes Leigh Syndrome (LS), a rare inherited metabolic disorder. Despite LS that arises as a result of inborn errors of energy metabolism, the specific contributions of ECHS1 deficiency to energy metabolism processes, developmental delay, and its mediated signaling mechanism remain unclear. Here, we identify a novel compound heterozygous variant [c.724G\u202f>\u202fA (p.Glu242Lys) and c.865G\u202f>\u202fA (Asp289Asn)] in the ECHS1 gene from a family of Han Chinese descent, with the affected individual displaying typical LS symptoms. The ECHS1 variants exhibit reduced 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase activity, resulting in a restricted ATP production rate, but the cellular ATP levels remains unchanged. ECHS1 deficiency also decreases cell viability and proliferation. Mechanistically, ECHS1 interacts with ADRB2, and its variants suppress the ADRB2/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Treatment with PKA signaling agonists or overexpression of PKA subunits in ECHS1-deficient cells can rescue the ATP production rate and restore cell viability. Additionally, the mitochondrial E3 ligase MUL1 mediates the ubiquitylation and degradation of ECHS1 protein variants. In conclusion, our study suggests that ECHS1 deficiency impairs mitochondrial respiratory efficiency, thereby lowering the ATP production rate, and reveals a promising therapeutic approach by targeting ADRB2/PKA signaling to combat ECHS1 deficiency-induced LS.",

      "abstract": "Adult-onset neurogenetic diseases (NGDs) with white matter abnormalities are rare and often misdiagnosed as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) due to overlapping clinical and radiological features. Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary immunosuppressive treatments and delayed genetic counseling. This study combines a retrospective multicenter analysis with a systematic review of the literature to assess the characteristics of patients with NGDs misdiagnosed as MS (Mis-MS) or with coexisting MS (NGD-MS), with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy. The retrospective study was conducted across seven tertiary MS centers in Europe and North America. Patients with confirmed NGDs initially misdiagnosed as MS or with coexisting MS were included. Clinical, radiological, and genetic data were analyzed. Brain MRIs were evaluated for MS-consistent and atypical features using standardized criteria. A systematic literature review of NGDs mimicking MS was also performed. The retrospective study included 46 patients (37 Mis-MS, 9 NGD-MS). Common NGDs in Mis-MS were Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) (22 %), Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia (ALSP) (8 %), and Adult-onset Alexander Disease (AOAD) (5 %). NGD-MS cases were primarily mitochondrial disorders (67 %). The median diagnostic delay for NGDs was nine years. Despite 80 % of Mis-MS patients showing atypical MRI features, 41 % met MS dissemination in space and 20 % dissemination in time criteria. CSF oligoclonal bands were absent in 92 % of Mis-MS patients but present in 83 % of NGD-MS patients. Literature review identified 81 Mis- MS and 22 NGD-MS cases, with Fabry disease and CADASIL most frequently involved. Diagnosing NGDs that mimic MS is challenging. CADASIL, ALSP, and AOAD were the most commonly misdiagnosed neurogenetic diseases as MS. Vasculopathies like CADASIL are challenging to differentiate from MS due to similar clinical and imaging features, including remitting course and gadolinium enhancement. Recognizing atypical MRI patterns and integrating clinical and genetic evaluations can improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care by preventing unnecessary MS treatment and enabling timely genetic counseling.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction of neurons is an important feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) is a protein that regulates mitochondrial function and protects cell from neuronal injury. However, the potential of FABP5 administration to restore mitochondria has not been fully explored. In this study, PC12 cells and rats were induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to establish PD models. Our results showed that FABP5 promoted cell proliferation and protected against mitochondrial damage, and reduced apoptosis in vitro and vivo. Moreover, FABP5 treatment alleviates motor and non-motor symptom injury in vivo. It also effectively modulated the PPAR\u03b3/SIRT1/PGC-1\u03b1 signaling pathway, thereby mitigating 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity. These results suggest that FABP5 exerts mitochondrial protection, inhibits apoptosis, restores damaged dopaminergic neurons, and slows down PD.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that probiotics may have a significant impact on the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the research focusing on the specific bacteria responsible for mitochondrial oxidative stress of AD remains limited. This study explores the impact and underlying mechanisms of probiotic W. confusa WMU005 on mitochondrial oxidative stress in AD. The probiotic W. confusa WMU005 was isolated from the healthy people. APP/PS1 mice were administered live W. confusa WMU005 for 4 weeks and then subjected to cognitive test. A\u03b2 deposition, Tau phosphorylation, neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial damage of brain were measured. Additionally, APP/SWE cells treated with W. confusa WMU005 fermentation broth showed altered levels of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1). Meanwhile, we confirmed that W. confusa WMU005 could regulate SIRT1 pathway in APP/PS1 mice. Our results revealed that W. confusa WMU005 improved cognitive function, reduced A\u03b2 and Tau pathology. Furthermore, W. confusa WMU005 treatment exerted antioxidative effects by activating the SIRT1 pathway. We further demonstrated that W. confusa WMU005 mitigated the mitochondrial oxidative stress via activating SIRT1 pathway in vitro. Meanwhile, we revealed that W. confusa WMU005 effectively inhibited the mitochondrial oxidative stress in the APP/PS1 mice by regulating SIRT1 pathway. These findings suggest that W. confusa WMU005 exerts protective effects on AD through the involvement of the SIRT1 signaling pathway, which opened avenues for novel therapeutic strategies towards treating AD.",

      "abstract": "The interplay between chronic inflammation, redox imbalance, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction is a central key in brain disorders (BD). This study aimed to develop an in vitro model using BV-2 microglial cells treated sequentially with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and kynurenine (KYN) to mimic chronic biochemical changes observed in BD. Moreover, a polyphenol-rich extract from Araucaria angustifolia (AAE) was tested to explore a possible therapeutic intervention. BV-2 cell line was exposed to LPS (10\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) plus KYN (1000 \u00b5M), and afterward, the ability of AAE (25\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) to reduce the changes induced by LPS\u2009+\u2009KYN was evaluated. As expected, the LPS\u2009+\u2009KYN combination reduced cell viability, increased reactive oxygen species production, compromised mitochondrial integrity, reduced ATP biosynthesis, and increased apoptosis rates (p\u2009<\u20090.05), perpetuating a self-sustaining inflammatory cycle. These changes (except inflammatory markers) were prevented by treatment with AAE, indicating the potential of this natural product as a possible adjuvant agent in treating patients with BD. Although in vitro studies do not replace in vivo models, the system proposed in this study can help better understand the biochemical changes in the glial microenvironment and serve as a preliminary screening of future drugs or herbal medicines for mitigating or reversing neurotoxic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Aflatoxins (AFs) are a group of toxic secondary metabolites and a dietary toxin produced predominantly by Aspergillus species such as Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. The four most common and harmful forms of AFs include Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), Aflatoxin B2 (AFB2), Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1), and Aflatoxin G2 (AFG2), which pose a significant health threat due to their widespread contamination of food and feed products. Particularly, AFB1 has raised a major global health concern. Noxious neurological outcomes have been associated with chronic exposure to AF-contaminated food, contributing to development of neuropathies, demyelinating diseases, and cognitive decline. Disrupted tight junctions of blood-brain barrier (BBB) said to have implicated by AFs toxicity by directly damaging brain endothelial cells. Compromised BBB leads to the formation of DNA adducts, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired oxidative phosphorylation, contributing to oxidative stress in neuronal cells. AFs disrupt neuronal signaling pathways by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and initiating chronic inflammation, impairing cognitive function and motor control. Mounting evidences suggests that these factors trigger neurological disorders especially neurodegenerative disorders. Neuroprotective compounds, such as hesperetin, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), curcumin, and artichoke extract, have shown promise in counteracting AF-induced neurotoxicity. These compounds could reduce oxidative stress, attenuate inflammation, and support mitochondrial function, offering potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate AF-induced neurodegeneration. This review focuses on the molecular pathways through which AFs exert neurotoxic effects, highlighting their role in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases and potential neuroprotective compounds for therapies have been highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with pathological hallmarks of loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Oxidative stress is one of the pivotal molecular pathways involved. Ferroptosis, a novel form of cell death, is closely associated with oxidative stress and presents a new potential therapeutic target for PD. Amounting reports showed that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, may hold potential for PD treatment. In this study, we found that Teneligliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, when pretreated in SH-SY5Y cells, alleviated MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced cellular damage, including enhancing cell viability and modulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Furthermore, Teneligliptin not only inhibited the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), prevented the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, restored glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents, but also lowered ferrous ion levels. At the same time, Teneligliptin restored antioxidant defenses by inhibiting DPP4 to enhance p62-mediated Keap1 degradation, thereby activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. This upregulated downstream target including HO-1 and xCT, maintaining glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression. Finally, Teneligliptin improved behavioral performance and protected dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-induced PD mouse. Taken together, our findings of Teneligliptin as a promising candidate for the treatment of PD warrant further study.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia as well as degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). A minority of PD cases are familial and are caused by a single genetic mutation. One of the most common PD-causing genes is leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), which causes an autosomal dominant PD that presents very similarly to sporadic PD. Pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 increase its kinase activity, indicated by both LRRK2 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of its substrates. To date, the mechanism(s) by which elevated LRRK2 kinase activity induces DA neuron degeneration and PD has not been fully elucidated. One potential mechanism may involve the role of LRRK2 on mitochondria, as mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to PD pathogenesis, and exciting recent evidence has connected PD pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 to multiple aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the disease. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge implicating LRRK2 in mitochondrial energetics, oxidative stress, genome integrity, fission/fusion, mitophagy, and ion/protein transport in PD, as well as examine the potential role LRRK2 may play in mediating the effects of mitochondrial therapeutics being investigated for treatment of PD.",

      "abstract": "Both mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms between ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction remain unclear. In the present study, we found that an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP<sup>+</sup>) showed increased intracellular peroxidation, leading to a significant increase in ERS. ER staining and immunofluorescence analysis of ERS-related proteins verified the presence of ERS, whereas transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed complete depletion of ER. Notably, treatment with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) to suppress ERS reduced apoptosis and concurrently reversed the ER micromorphology. Furthermore, 4-PBA alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction, as shown by increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), upregulation of electron transport chain proteins, and restoration of mitochondrial integrity. Further studies revealed that the effect of 4-PBA could be attributed to the modulation of the mitochondrial Rho-GTPase 1 (Miro1)-mitophagy axis. In vivo experiments in Parkinson's disease models demonstrated that inhibiting ERS reduced dopaminergic neuron loss while improving cognitive and motor function. Collectively, these findings indicate that treatments targeting ERS may be potential candidates for treating PD.",

      "title": "Aging-induced alterations in microglial cells and their impact on neurodegenerative disorders.",
      "abstract": "Senescence causes deterioration in the functioning and physiology of an organism. Microglia, the standing resident immune brain cells transform from neuroprotective to neurotoxic with age. Rapid process motility and cellular migration of microglia in the developing brain, and other characteristics are regarded to be crucial for immunological defense and tissue repair. As they mature, microglia not only differ in their morphology but also in their functioning. However, the exact mechanism related to the atrophies caused by aged microglia or their role in neurodegenerative diseases is still uncertain. The aim of this updated review is to provide insights of how aging microglial cells change and how this influences the development of neurodegenerative diseases. As life expectancy rises, there is an increase in the accumulation of iron, ROS/NOS, protein misfolding and insufficient clearing of debris. This is attributed to the age-dependent alterations in the genes linked to energy metabolism, mitochondrial and lysosome function, and neuroinflammation. Aging microglia often shifts towards a pro-inflammatory state with a reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Aging microglia fail to clear amyloid-beta plaques, accelerates tau-pathology and enhances the chronic neuroinflammation, exacerbating the \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. These changes significantly impacted the onset of various neurogenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease etc. However, it is important to note that these microglial aging effects might not be perceived as absolute, due to various limitations such as microglial heterogeneity, intercellular complexity across brain regions and variability in human aging owing to genetic and epigenetic variations. Regardless of this the future perspective of such insights are of immense relevance as novel therapeutic approaches can be formulated if the molecular and cellular mechanisms of aging microglial perturbations are understood. Future research should focus on restoring microglial homeostasis to mitigate the effects of aging on the brain and slowing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a systemic disorder with a substantial metabolic disorder component, where the liver significantly impacts the brain via the liver-brain axis. Key mechanisms include the liver's role in clearing peripheral \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), the influence of hepatic enzymes and metabolites on cognitive decline, and the systemic effects of metabolic disorders on AD progression. Hepatokines, liver-secreted proteins including fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), Fetuin-A, Midbrain astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), Adropin and Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), could regulate insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, immune responses, and neurotrophic support. These pathways are closely linked to core AD pathologies, including A\u03b2 aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Lifestyle interventions, including exercise and dietary modifications, that regulate hepatokines expression may offer novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for AD. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the liver-brain crosstalk in AD, emphasizing the mechanistic role of liver in bridging metabolic dysfunction with neurodegeneration and underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of hepatokines in addressing AD's complex pathology.",

      "abstract": "Oroxylum indicum (O. indicum) is a common traditional Chinese medicine, but its neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's disease (PD) model have not been fully elaborated. Mitochondrial complex I dysfunction is the core pathology of oxidative stress injury in PD, and the mechanism of regulating the activity of its key subunit NADH: Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Core Subunit S3 (NDUFS3) has not been clarified. To explore the potential therapeutic effects of O. indicum on PD and reveal the potential active compounds and molecular mechanism of action behind the treatment of PD by O indicum extract (OIE), in the present study, the mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFS3 was selected as the PD disease target, and a \"three-in-one\" system combing target purification of NDUFS3 protein, affinity ultrafiltration screening and validation-analysis of molecular mechanism was constructed. Results suggest that the active compounds in O indicum screened by affinity screening can target and regulate the expression of NDUFS3, lower the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduce oxidative stress, and increase the ATP content, thus exerting anti-PD effects at the cellular and animal levels. The integrated approach of protein purification, affinity ultrafiltration screening and pharmacological validation is pivotal for efficiently identifying active compounds and uncovering their mechanisms in anti-PD research, thereby proving a reference for drug discovery of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "The downstream signaling pathways of TLR activation involve a family of adaptor proteins, including MYD88, TIRAP, TRIF, TRAM, and SARM1. The first four proteins stimulate inflammatory and antiviral responses, playing crucial roles in innate immunity against various pathogens. In contrast, SARM1 promotes immunity to microorganisms in invertebrate animals independently of TLRs, and negatively regulates inflammatory responses in metazoan organisms. SARM1 inhibits TRIF, reduces the activation of various inflammasomes, and induces mitochondrial damage and cell death to eliminate hyperactivated cells. This regulation is essential to ensure timely control of immune responses and to prevent excessive inflammation. Recently, it was discovered that SARM1 can hydrolyze NAD, a critical component of cellular metabolism. The reduction of NAD levels by SARM1 is linked to the progression of Wallerian degeneration following neuronal injury and may also play a role in the immunoregulation of lymphoid and myeloid cells. Since SARM1 can be pharmacologically modulated, it presents promising opportunities for developing treatments for inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Besides diabetes mellitus, metformin has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent for treating various other conditions that include various cancers, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging. In cancer, metformin increased apoptotic cell death, while inhibiting it in neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, different modes of metformin action at the molecular level have been proposed. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we present the mitochondria and the VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel) as a potential target of metformin. <b>Results:</b> Metformin induces VDAC1 overexpression, its oligomerization, and subsequent apoptosis. Metformin analogs phenformin and buformin at much lower concentrations also induce VDAC1 overexpression, oligomerization, and cell death. We demonstrate the interaction of metformin with purified VDAC1, which inhibited its channel conduction in a voltage-dependent manner. Metformin bound to the synthetic VDAC1-<i>N</i>-terminal peptide and binding to this domain was also found by its molecular docking with VDAC1. Moreover, we demonstrated metformin binding to purified hexokinases (HK-I) with a 400-fold lower metformin concentration than that required for cell death induction. In cells, metformin induced HK-I detachment from the mitochondrial VDAC1. Lastly, metformin increased the expression of NLRP3 and ASC and induced their co-localization, suggesting inflammasome activation. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results suggest that VDAC1 is a target for metformin and its analogs, and this is associated with metformin's adverse effects on many diseases.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we have examined the neuroprotective effects of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used in vitro electrophysiological recording in hippocampal slices and performed proteomic analysis of cortical tissue from APP<sub>swe</sub>/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. In wild-type (WT) slices from C57BL6 mice, acute treatment with CBDA (10 \u03bcM) did not alter levels of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP); however, it did reverse the attenuation of LTP produced by acute beta amyloid peptide (A\u03b2<sub>42</sub>). We also examined the effects of CBDA or vehicle in APP/PS1 mice and WT littermates over a 5-week period at 8 months. LTP levels recorded in slices from WT mice treated with CBDA at 1, 10, or 30 mg/kg (IP) or vehicle were similar. LTP was attenuated in slices from vehicle-treated APP/PS1 compared to vehicle-treated WT mice, while treatment of APP/PS1 mice with all doses of CBDA reversed the deficits in LTP. There was also a deficit in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) in vehicle-treated APP/PS1 compared to WT, indicating altered synaptic function and transmitter release; this was reversed in slices from CBDA-treated APP/PS1 mice. Levels of cortical soluble A\u03b2<sub>42</sub> were similar across CBDA- and vehicle-treated groups; however, the level of aggregated A\u03b2<sub>42</sub> was decreased in the CBDA-treated group. Proteomic analysis of cortical tissue from APP/PS1 cortex compared to WT revealed alterations in protein expression, with pathway enrichment analyses suggesting implicated canonical pathways, including mitochondrial dysfunction, protein sorting, and synaptogenesis; all were significantly improved by CBDA treatment. These changes likely facilitate the improvement in synaptic transmission and LTP we observed following CBDA treatment in APP/PS1 mice. This research suggests that CBDA should be considered a novel therapy for AD.",

      "title": "BDNF/proBDNF Interplay in the Mediation of Neuronal Apoptotic Mechanisms in Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
      "abstract": "The neurotrophic system includes neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its precursor proBDNF, which play conflicting roles in neuronal survival and apoptosis, with their balance having a significant impact on neurodegenerative outcomes. While BDNF is widely acknowledged as a potent neurotrophin that promotes neuronal survival and differentiation, its precursor, proBDNF, has the opposite effect, promoting apoptosis and neuronal death. This review highlights the new and unique aspects of BDNF/proBDNF interaction in the modulation of neuronal apoptotic pathways in neurodegenerative disorders. It systematically discusses the cross-talk in apoptotic signaling at the molecular level, whereby BDNF activates survival pathways such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK, whereas proBDNF activates p75NTR and sortilin to induce neuronal apoptosis via JNK, RhoA, NFkB, and Rac-GTPase pathways such as caspase activation and mitochondrial injury. Moreover, this review emphasizes the factors that affect the balance between proBDNF and BDNF levels within the context of neurodegeneration, including proteolytic processing, the expression of TrkB and p75NTR receptors, and extrinsic gene transcription regulators. Cellular injury, stress, or signaling pathway alterations can disrupt the balance of BDNF/proBDNF, which may be involved in apoptotic-related neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. This review provides a comprehensive framework for targeting neurotrophin signaling in the development of innovative therapies for neuronal survival and managing apoptotic-related neurodegenerative disorders, addressing the mechanistic complexity and clinical feasibility of BDNF/proBDNF interaction.",

      "abstract": "The m.13513G>A (p.Asp393Asn) substitution in the <i>MT-ND5</i> (Mitochondrially Encoded NADH/Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Core Subunit 5) gene is a common pathogenic variant associated with primary mitochondrial disorders. It frequently causes Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactate acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). In this study, we present clinical data, heteroplasmy levels in various tissues (blood, urine, and skin fibroblasts), and bioenergetic characteristics from a cohort of 20 unrelated patients carrying the m.13513G>A mutation, classified according to the following phenotypes: Leigh syndrome (<i>n</i> = 12), MELAS (<i>n</i> = 2), and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON, <i>n</i> = 6). We observed a significant correlation between high respiratory ratios and heteroplasmy levels in fibroblast cell lines of the patients. Furthermore, fibroblast cell lines with heteroplasmy levels exceeding 55% exhibited markedly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the clinical and bioenergetic profiles of patients with m.13513G>A-variant-related phenotypes across different heteroplasmy levels, based on data from a single genetic center. Our data suggest that even a slight shift in heteroplasmy can improve cellular function and, consequently, the patients' phenotype, providing a solid foundation for the development of future gene therapies for mtDNA diseases.",

      "abstract": "Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a rare neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by severe hypoplasia or atrophy of pons and cerebellum that may be associated with other brain malformations, microcephaly, optic nerve atrophy, dystonia, ataxia and neuromuscular disorders. At this time, there are 17 variants of PCH distinguished by clinical presentation and distinctive radiological and biochemical features in addition to pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia. PCH1 is defined as PCH variant associated with anterior horn degeneration in the spinal cord with muscle weakness and hypotonia, and is associated with recessive variants in genes VRK1, EXOSC3, EXOSC8, EXOSC9 and SLC25A46. Neuromuscular manifestations may clinically present as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), motor neuropathy (HMN) or neuronopathy (non-5q spinal muscular atrophy; SMA) or sensorimotor polyneuropathy (HMSN). Physiologic functions of PCH1-associated genes include regulation of RNA metabolism, mitochondrial fission and neuronal migration. Overall, complex phenotypes associated with PCH1 gene variants ranging from PCH and related neurodevelopmental disorders combined with neuromuscular disorders to isolated neuromuscular disorders have variable outcomes with isolated neuromuscular disorders typically having later onset with better outcomes. Improved understanding of pathogenesis of pontocerebellar hypoplasia and its association with motor neuronopathies and peripheral neuropathies may provide us with valuable insights and lead to potential new therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders.",

Mitochondria, key organelles in the production of cellular energy, play an important role in this tissue dysfunction. Numerous studies highlight the close link between obesity and adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in excessive ROS production and adipose tissue inflammation. This inflammation is transmitted systemically, leading to metabolic disorders that also impact the central nervous system, where pro-inflammatory cytokines impair mitochondrial and cellular functions in different areas of the brain, leading to neurodegenerative diseases. To date, several bioactive compounds are able to prevent and/or slow down neurogenerative processes by acting on mitochondrial functions. Among these, some molecules present in the Mediterranean diet, such as polyphenols, carotenoids, and omega-3 PUFAs, exert a protective action due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ability. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the involvement of adipose tissue dysfunction in the development of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, emphasizing the central role played by mitochondria, the main actors in the cross-talk between adipose tissue and the central nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a high prevalence among the middle-aged and elderly population. The pathogenesis of PD is closely linked to the misfolding and aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein, which contributes to the formation of Lewy bodies. These processes are associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, a key neuropathological change that underlies the motor symptoms of PD. In addition, genetic susceptibility, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are involved in the progress of the disease. Previous studies indicated that the dysregulation of epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, may be the key pathophysiological factors in PD. <i>N</i>6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a dynamically reversible modification in eukaryotes RNA, and could regulate mRNA degradation, stability, maturation, and translation. Recently, clinical research has shown that the global m6A level is significantly reduced in PD patients as well as the expression changes in m6A-associated proteins. Moreover, the dysregulation of m6A modification was shown to impact dopamine metabolism and damage dopaminergic neurons, indicating that m6A RNA modification may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD. In this review, we summarize recent clinical studies on m6A RNA modification in PD patients and discuss the regulatory role of m6A modification in dopamine metabolism and dopaminergic neurons death. Furthermore, based on the different m6A modification databases and prediction websites, we analyzed the potential m6A modification sites on the mRNA of key PD pathogenic genes (<i>SNCA</i>, <i>PRKN</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>LRRK2</i>) for the first time, aiming to offer new gene targets and perspectives understanding the pathogenesis of PD.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence links ferroptosis-mitochondrial dysregulation to depression pathogenesis through an oxidative stress-energy deficit-neuroinflammation cycle driven by iron overload. This study demonstrates that iron accumulation initiates ferroptosis via Fenton reaction-mediated lipid peroxidation, compromising neuronal membrane integrity and disabling the GPx4 antioxidant system. Concurrent mitochondrial complex I/IV dysfunction impairs ATP synthesis, creating an AMPK/mTOR signaling imbalance and calcium dyshomeostasis that synergistically impair synaptic plasticity. Bidirectional crosstalk emerges: lipid peroxidation derivatives oxidize mitochondrial cardiolipin, while mitochondrial ROS overproduction activates ACSL4 to amplify ferroptotic susceptibility, forming a self-reinforcing neurodegenerative loop. Prefrontal-hippocampal metabolomics reveal paradoxical metabolic reprogramming with glycolytic compensation suppressing mitochondrial biogenesis (via PGC-1\u03b1/TFAM downregulation), trapping neurons in bioenergetic crisis. Clinical data further show that microglial M1 polarization through cGAS-STING activation sustains neuroinflammation via IL-6/TNF-\u03b1 release. We propose a \"ferroptosis-mitochondrial fragmentation-metabolic maladaptation\" triad as mechanistic subtyping criteria for depression. Preclinical validation shows that combinatorial therapy (iron chelators + SIRT3 agonists) rescues neuronal viability by restoring mitochondrial integrity and energy flux. This work shifts therapeutic paradigms from monoaminergic targets toward multimodal strategies addressing iron homeostasis, organelle dynamics, and metabolic vulnerability-a framework with significant implications for developing neuroprotective antidepressants.",

This review focuses on two classes of lesions: the two 8-oxopurine (8-oxo-Pu) lesions that are repaired by the base excision repair (BER) enzyme and the four 5',8-cyclopurine (cPu) lesions that are repaired exclusively by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) enzyme. The aim is to correlate the simultaneous quantification of these two classes of lesions in the context of neurological disorders. The first half is a summary of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with particular attention to the pathways of hydroxyl radical (HO<sup>\u2022</sup>) formation, followed by a summary of protocols for the quantification of six lesions and the biomimetic chemistry of the HO<sup>\u2022</sup> radical with double-stranded oligonucleotides (ds-ODN) and calf thymus DNA (ct-DNA). The second half addresses two neurodegenerative diseases: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). The quantitative data on the six lesions obtained from genomic and/or mitochondrial DNA extracts across several XP and CS cell lines are discussed. Oxidative stress contributes to oxidative DNA damage by resulting in the accumulation of cPu and 8-oxo-Pu in DNA. The formation of cPu is the postulated culprit inducing neurological symptoms associated with XP and CS.",

      "abstract": "Irisin is a peptide derived from fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) and is primarily produced by muscle fibers under the regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1) during exercise. Irisin has been the subject of extensive research due to its potential as a metabolic regulator and its antioxidant properties. Notably, it has been associated with protective actions within the brain. Despite growing interest, many questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects. This review summarizes recent findings on irisin, highlighting its pleiotropic functions and the biological processes and molecular cascades involved in its action, with a particular focus on the central nervous system. Irisin plays a crucial role in neuron survival, differentiation, growth, and development, while also promoting mitochondrial homeostasis, regulating apoptosis, and facilitating autophagy-processes essential for normal neuronal function. Emerging evidence suggests that irisin may improve conditions associated with non-communicable neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multiple sclerosis. Given its diverse benefits, irisin holds promise as a novel therapeutic agent for preventing and treating neurological diseases.",

Strategy to improve and restore mitochondrial function, as well as to treat mitochondria-associated diseases, as observed in the pathophysiology of AD and PD. The current study aimed to investigate the potential of mitotherapy in AD and PD in preclinical studies. We conducted a systematic search of articles in English related to mitotherapy in AD and PD animal models published until October 2024 in the selected bibliographic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, and the reference lists of relevant review articles published. The quality of the final selected studies was assessed using the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Studies (CAMARADES) checklists and the SYRCLE risk of bias tool. The initial search resulted in 231 studies, and after screening the titles and abstracts, 30 studies were recognized. Finally, 7 studies met the inclusion criteria. Despite restricted knowledge of the mitotherapy mechanisms, evidence shows that exogenous mitochondria exert neuroprotective effects via improving mitochondrial function, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in preclinical models of AD and PD. This systematic review summarizes the preclinical studies on mitotherapy and provides evidence favoring mitochondria transplantation's protective effects in animal PD and AD models.",

      "title": "Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibition Improves Alzheimer's Disease Hallmarks: Correlation with Peripheral Inflammation and Gut Microbiota Modulation.",
      "abstract": "Targeting brain inflammation has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy to cope with neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, accumulating data suggest that the gut microbiota partially exerts its neurodegenerative effects by exacerbating neuroinflammation through increased pathogenic or unhealthy genera that releases different types of cytokines in the periphery. Recently, soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme (sEH) emerged as a new pharmacological approach for treating Alzheimer's Disease. Treatment with a sEH inhibitor (UB-BJ-02) modified the gut microbiota in the 5xFAD mouse model, increasing health-promoting genera such as Lactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus. By contrast, pro-inflammatory genera (e.g., Bacteroides) were decreased. UB-BJ-02 treatment enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory peripheral mediators in the colon and spleen, such as Il-10. 5xFAD mice treated with UB-BJ-02 showed improved short- and long-term memory and spatial memory compared to 5xFAD control. Furthermore, we found a reduction in neuroinflammatory markers evaluated by immunohistochemical assays, such as GFAP and IBA-1, and gene expression, such as Il-1\u03b2, Tnf-a, Il-6, and Trem2, in the brain of 5xFAD-treated mice and a significant decrease in the number of A\u03b2 plaques. T Treatment decreased DRP1 protein levels while increasing OPA1 levels, resulting in improved mitochondrial function corroborated by the elevation of Pgc1-\u03b1. Interestingly, a correlation between UB-BJ-02 brain effects and microbiota changes were demonstrated. To validate this correlation, we fed CL4176 AD transgenic strain, with Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Bacteroides rodentium. Consequently, we observed that changes in feeding modified the number of A\u03b2 plaques and neuroinflammatory markers in C. elegans. Therefore, the present study suggested that sEH inhibition with UB-BJ-02 promoted neuroprotective effects, modulating gut microbiota and modifying peripheral and brain pro-inflammatory markers.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial autophagy is a critical quality control mechanism that eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria to maintain cellular homeostasis. Among receptor-dependent mitophagy pathways, FUN14 domain-containing 1 (FUNDC1)-a mitochondrial outer membrane protein harboring an LC3-interacting region (LIR)-plays a central role by directly binding to LC3 under stress conditions, thereby initiating autophagosome encapsulation of damaged organelles. Emerging evidence implicates FUNDC1 dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), where defective mitophagy exacerbates hallmark pathologies including A\u03b2 plaque deposition and hyperphosphorylated Tau-driven neurofibrillary tangles. Despite advances, the molecular interplay between FUNDC1 phosphorylation states (e.g., Ser13/Ser17/Tyr18) and AD progression remains poorly defined. This review systematically examines FUNDC1's dual regulatory role in mitophagy, its mechanistic links to A\u03b2 and Tau pathologies, and the therapeutic potential of targeting FUNDC1-associated kinases (e.g., ULK1, CK2) or downstream effectors (e.g., DRP1, OPA1) to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. By synthesizing recent preclinical and clinical findings, we aim to bridge the gap between FUNDC1 biology and AD therapeutics, highlighting actionable nodes for drug development.",

The purpose of the review is to analyze current studies of pathogenetic (disease-modifying therapy) of AD. According to modern concepts, AD pathogenesis is associated with the accumulation of amyloid protein, hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, etc. The most promising pathogenetic therapy is currently considered anti-amyloid antibodies, anti-tau therapies, and antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory therapy. Anti-amyloid therapies such as aducanumab, lecanumab, and donanemab have recently been officially approved for practical use in some countries around the world. Therapeutic strategies for tau protein-related disorders, neuroinflammation, insulin resistance, and other neurodegeneration mechanisms are also being actively studied. Along with drug therapy, noninvasive brain stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial electrical stimulation, which have a high safety profile and proven effectiveness, are actively developing.",

This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD, such as alpha-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, while focusing on the impact of gut dysbiosis on intestinal barrier function and its role in reduced neurochemical production. The clinical features of PD, including dopamine, serotonin, and GABA deficiencies, are examined, with a focus on how dysbiosis contributes to neurotransmitter depletion. Current treatments of PD, such as levodopa and dopamine agonists, are discussed alongside gut health therapies such as probiotics, prebiotics, and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT). Future therapeutic directions, including synbiotics, engineered microbes, phage therapy, and the integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), are explored. The chapter also considers preventive strategies, such as lifestyle adjustments and early gut health monitoring using modern diagnostic tools and biosensors. Furthermore, a strong need for continued research into the gut-brain axis (GBA) to develop more effective, gut-targeted therapies for managing PD is discussed.",

However, extensive research in the last decade has shown the prominent efficacy of NAC in many neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. NAC acts through multiple mechanisms; primarily, it releases cysteine and modulates glutamatergic and monoaminergic transmission. Further, it restores glutathione levels, promotes oxidative balance, reverses decreased synaptic plasticity, reduces neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, and provides neurotrophic support. Additionally, it regulates one-carbon metabolism pathways, leading to the production of key metabolites. In this review, we will be discussing in-depth mechanisms of action of NAC and its promising ability to reverse neuropathological changes, particularly cognitive deficits, and associated plasticity changes in various psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, including depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, traumatic brain injury, aging. Overall, several preclinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of NAC in reversing regressive plasticity, cognitive deficits, and associated changes in the brain. NAC remains among the strongest candidates with a high safety profile for managing several types of neurological disorders.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a complex interplay between amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptosis, suggesting that multi-target therapies may be more effective than single-target treatments. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have shown protective effects against AD in hypertensive patients. However, those poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability exhibit limited efficacy in neurodegenerative disorders. This study investigated the neuroprotective potential of three ARBs and one ACEI using a combined in vitro and in vivo approach. In N2a and N2a-APPswe cell lines, irbesartan showed the most robust effects, notably increasing p-AKT and HMOX1 levels. Based on these results, irbesartan was selected for the following in vivo studies and administered intranasally (40\u202fmg/kg) to APP/PS1 male mice for 10 weeks. Treated animals showed significant improvements in memory performance, as measured by the novel object recognition test and the Morris water maze. Additionally, irbesartan enhanced dendritic spine density, restored mitochondrial bioenergetics and BBB integrity, and reduced apoptotic markers. These effects were accompanied by a marked reduction in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Overall, these results support the potential of intranasal irbesartan as a promising multi-target therapeutic strategy for AD, capable of modulating key pathological features, including synaptic dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation.",

      "abstract": "Age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, represent major global health challenges, particularly with an aging population. Mitochondrial dysfunction appears to play a central role in the pathophysiology of these conditions by driving redox dysregulation and impairing cellular energy metabolism. Despite extensive research, effective therapeutic options remain limited. Cannabinol (CBN), a cannabinoid previously identified as a potent inhibitor of oxytosis/ferroptosis through mitochondrial modulation, has demonstrated promising neuroprotective effects. In cell culture, CBN targets mitochondria, preserving mitochondrial membrane potential, enhancing antioxidant defenses and regulating bioenergetic processes. However, the in vivo therapeutic potential of CBN, particularly in aging models, has not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, this study investigated the effects of CBN on age-associated cognitive decline and metabolic dysfunction using the SAMP8 mouse model of accelerated aging. Our results show that CBN significantly improves spatial learning and memory, with more pronounced cognitive benefits observed in female mice. These cognitive improvements are accompanied by sex-specific changes in metabolic parameters, such as enhanced oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. Mechanistically, CBN modulates key regulators of mitochondrial dynamics, including mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), while upregulating markers of mitochondrial biogenesis including mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOM20). Additionally, CBN upregulates key synaptic proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and postsynaptic signaling suggesting that it enhances synaptic function and neurotransmission, further reinforcing its neuroprotective effects. This study provides in vivo evidence supporting CBN's potential to mitigate age-related cognitive and metabolic dysfunction, with notable sex-specific effects, highlighting its promise for neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline.",

Classic multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), also known as glutaric aciduria type II (GAII), is a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders caused by mutations in the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETFQO). Growing evidence suggests that late-onset classic MADD due to ETFQO mutations is a primary cause of LSM. In addition to classic MADD, MADD-like disorders have also been identified as contributing factors to LSM, as supported by numerous studies. This review summarizes recent advances in the clinical, pathological, biochemical, and molecular features, as well as treatment outcomes, of LSM with various etiologies, with a particular focus on the latest findings regarding MADD-like disorders.",

Recent studies have identified mitochondrial dysfunction and the resultant oxidative stress as crucial contributors to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Polyphenols, naturally occurring compounds with inherent antioxidant properties, have demonstrated the potential to target mitochondria and mitigate oxidative stress. This therapeutic potential has garnered significant attention in recent years. Investigating the mitochondrial targeting capacity of polyphenols, their role in functional regulation, and their ability to modulate oxidative stress, along with exploring novel technologies and strategies for modifying polyphenol compounds and their formulations, holds promise for providing new avenues for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

With its incidence rising annually, the multi-mechanistic pathogenesis of PD presents new opportunities for the development of multi-target therapies. While previous studies have explored the therapeutic potential of natural products in PD, existing reviews often focus on single mechanisms or a limited number of compounds. While previous studies have explored the therapeutic potential of natural products in PD, existing reviews often focus on single mechanisms or a limited number of compounds. This article systematically evaluates preclinical studies published between 2018 and 2025, encompassing 32 bioactive components and 10 categories of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas. It highlights the therapeutic potential of TCM active ingredients for PD by examining key mechanisms, including oxidative stress, ferroptosis, neuroinflammation, gut microbiota imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. By integrating these insights, this review provides an interdisciplinary perspective to guide the development of next-generation botanical drugs for PD.",

One of the key factors contributing to the pathogenesis of these diseases is the disrupted crosstalk between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which are regions where the ER interfaces with mitochondria, serve as crucial platforms facilitating communication between these organelles. This review focuses on the structural composition and functions of MAMs and highlights their roles. Additionally, in this review, we summarize the relationship between MAM dysfunction and various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and others. The involvement of key proteins such as Sig-1R, IP3R, and VAPB in maintaining ER-mitochondrial communication and their dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases is emphasized. Through analyzing the effects of MAM on neurodegenerative diseases, we provide the newest insights and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of these debilitating conditions.",

      "title": "Application of IVDr NMR spectroscopy to stratify Parkinson's disease with absolute quantitation of blood serum metabolites and lipoproteins.",
      "abstract": "The challenge of early detection and stratification in Parkinson's disease (PD) is urgent due to the current emergence of mechanism-based disease-modifying treatments. In here, metabolomic and lipidomic parameters obtained by a standardized and targeted in vitro diagnostic research (IVDr) platform have a significant potential to address therapy-related questions and generate improved biomarker panels. Our study aimed to use IVDr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to quantify metabolites and lipoproteins in PD blood serum from different cohorts to stratify metabolically driven subtypes of idiopathic and genetic PD. Serum aliquots from three neurodegeneration biobank cohorts (287 samples in total, including 62 PD patient samples with GBA mutation, 98/43 PD patient samples of early/late stages of disease duration, 20 PD samples from patients with mutations in recessive PD genes and some smaller subgroups of mitochondrial and double mutation cases) were prepared and analyzed with IVDr NMR spectroscopy, covering 39 blood serum metabolites and 112 lipoprotein parameters. Uni- and multivariate statistics were used to identify metabolism-driven changes under consideration of typical confounders such as age, sex and disease duration and set into context with clinical biomarkers such as CSF concentrations of alpha-synuclein, neurofilament light chain, and tau protein. Based on the different PD subgroups we performed a total of eight different comparisons. Highlights from these comparisons include increased citrate and dimethylglycine with a decrease of creatinine and methionine in healthy controls and early PD group compared to GBA, PD late and recessive PD. We furthermore identified decreased HDL-3 free cholesterol in genetic PD cases compared to sporadic subject samples (sum of the PD early and PD late groups). Considering medication, we found that the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) is mostly positively correlated with tyrosine and citrate in sporadic PD compared to pyruvate and phenylalanine in genetic PD. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alpha-synuclein were negatively correlated with alanine. Further metabolites and lipoproteins with discriminatory power for double mutation PD cases involved ornithine, 2-aminobutyrate and 2-hydroxybutyrate as well as for mitochondrial phenotypes via LDL phospholipid, apolipoprotein and cholesterol subfractions. Quantitative IVDr NMR serum spectroscopy is able to stratify PD patient samples of different etiology and can contribute to a wider understanding of the underlying metabolism-driven alterations e.g. in energy, amino acid, and lipoprotein metabolism. Though our overall cohort was large, major confounders such as age, sex and medication have a strong impact. That is why absolute quantification and detailed patient knowledge about metabolic confounders, is a premise for future translation of NMR serum spectroscopy to routine PD diagnostics.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) share key pathological features, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagic dysfunction, and DNA damage. By identifying cytosolic DNA and triggering the type I interferon response, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway regulates neuroinflammation. Dysregulated cGAS-STING signaling has been linked to neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration across multiple neurodegenerative conditions. In many neurodegenerative disorders, neuroinflammation is mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway. Mitochondrial malfunction and impaired autophagy cause cytosolic DNA buildup in Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases, which activates cGAS-STING and drives chronic inflammation. This pathway is triggered by TDP-43 pathology and nucleic acid dysregulation in ALS and FTD, which leads to neuronal destruction. Both central demyelination and peripheral immunological responses are linked to cGAS-STING activation in multiple sclerosis. Various inhibitors, such as RU.521, H-151, and naturally occurring compounds like metformin, potentially attenuate cGAS-STING-mediated neuroinflammation and associated pathologies. H-151 significantly decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in murine macrophage J774 cells activated with cGAMP: TNF-\u03b1 by 68\u00a0%, IFN-\u03b2 by 84\u00a0%, and CXCL10 by 96\u00a0%. cGAS-STING inhibitors target neuroinflammation, offering a disease-modifying approach unlike current symptomatic treatments. However, challenges like blood-brain barrier penetration, off-target effects, and immune suppression hinder clinical translation, necessitating optimized drug delivery and immune modulation. With a focus on its potential for future clinical applications, this review explores the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in neurodegeneration and new treatment approaches.",

Their dysfunction is linked to devastating diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac disorders, and cancer. Here, we present a knockout mouse model lacking the complex IV assembly factor SMIM20/MITRAC7. SMIM20<sup>-/-</sup> mice display cardiac pathology with reduced heart weight and cardiac output. Heart mitochondria present with reduced levels of complex IV associated with increased complex I activity, have altered fatty acid oxidation, and display elevated levels of ROS production. Interestingly, mutant mouse ventricular myocytes show unphysiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, which can be attributed to the increase in mitochondrial ROS production. Our study presents an example of a tissue-specific phenotype in the context of OXPHOS dysfunction. Moreover, our data suggest a link between complex IV dysfunction and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling at the endoplasmic reticulum through ROS signaling.",

      "title": "Therapeutic implications of mitochondrial transfer on stem cell fate in regenerative medicine.",
      "abstract": "With the discovery of intercellular mitochondrial transfer, the intricate mitochondrial regulatory networks on stem cell fate have aroused intense academic interest. Apart from capturing freely released mitochondria from donor cells, stem cells are able to receive mitochondria through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), gap junctional channels (GJCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially when undergoing stressful conditions such as inflammation, hypoxia, chemotherapy drug exposure, and irradiation. Stem cells that are potentiated by exogenous mitochondria show enhanced potential for proliferation, differentiation, and immunomodulation. The well-tolerated nature of either autogenous or allogenous mitochondria when locally injected in the human ischemic heart has validated the safety and therapeutic potential of mitochondrial transplantation. In children diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA deletion syndrome, functional improvements have been observed when empowering their hematopoietic stem cells with maternally derived mitochondria. Apart from the widely investigated applications of mitochondrial transfer in ischemia-reperfusion injury, neurodegenerative diseases and mitochondrial diseases etc., therapeutic potentials of mitochondrial transfer in tissue repair and regeneration are equally noteworthy, though there has been no systematic summary in this regard.This review analyzed the research and development trends of mitochondrial transfer in stem cells and regenerative medicine over the past decade from a bibliometric perspective, introduced the concept and associated mechanisms of mitochondrial transfer, summarized the regulations of intercellular mitochondrial transfer on stem cell fate. Finally, the therapeutic application of mitochondrial transplantation in diseases and tissue regeneration has been reviewed, including recent clinical studies related to mitochondrial transplantation.Mitochondrial transfer shows promise in modifying and reshaping the cellular properties of stem cells, making them more conducive to regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived mitochondria have shown multifaceted potential in promoting the revitalization and regeneration of cardiac, cutaneous, muscular, neuronal tissue. This review integrates novel research findings on mitochondrial transfer in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, emphasizing the crucial translational value of mitochondrial transfer in regeneration. It serves to underscore the significant impact of mitochondrial transfer and provides a valuable reference for further exploration in this field.",

      "abstract": "Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a rare, inherited progressive movement disorder for which there is currently no cure. The field urgently requires more sensitive, objective, and clinically relevant biomarkers to enhance the evaluation of treatment efficacy in clinical trials and to speed up the process of drug discovery. This study pioneers the development of clinically relevant, multidomain, fully objective composite biomarkers of disease severity and progression, using multimodal neuroimaging and background data (i.e., demographic, disease history, genetics). Data from 31 individuals with FRDA and 31 controls from a longitudinal multimodal natural history study IMAGE-FRDA, were included. Using an elasticnet predictive machine learning (ML) regression model, we derived a weighted combination of background, structural MRI, diffusion MRI, and quantitative susceptibility imaging (QSM) measures that predicted Friedreich ataxia rating scale (FARS) with high accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.79, root mean square error (RMSE)\u2009=\u200913.19). This composite also exhibited strong sensitivity to disease progression over two years (Cohen's d\u2009=\u20091.12), outperforming the sensitivity of the FARS score alone (d\u2009=\u20090.88). The approach was validated using the Scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), demonstrating the potential and robustness of ML-derived composites to surpass individual biomarkers and act as complementary or surrogate markers of disease severity and progression. However, further validation, refinement, and the integration of additional data modalities will open up new opportunities for translating these biomarkers into clinical practice and clinical trials for FRDA, as well as other rare neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "The sense of smell is essential for human perception. Olfactory function declines with increasing age, affecting a substantial portion of the elderly population, and this decline is more pronounced in men. This reduction can be attributed to anatomical and degenerative changes in the brain and olfactory receptors. There is robust clinical evidence indicating an association between olfactory perception decline/deficit (OPD) and major neurodegenerative diseases, with severe deficits observed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and milder effects noted in other conditions. However, its molecular bases have not yet been identified. Here, we explored the molecular connection between OPD and Parkinson's disease by conducting data-mining, gene enrichment analysis, and examining protein-interaction networks using systems biology approaches. We found pathways associated with both OPD and Parkinson's disease, identifying over 300 relevant genes. These genes belong to biologically relevant gene families, including transporters, kinases, nuclear receptors, transcription factors, and olfactory and other G protein-coupled receptors. Functional enrichment analysis revealed shared biological processes between OPD and Parkinson's disease, such as synaptic signalling and neuroinflammation. Mitochondrial gene enrichment was unique to Parkinson's. Both conditions exhibited a scarcity of associated genes on the Y chromosome but an even distribution on the non-pseudoautosomal region of the\u00a0X\u00a0chromosome, potentially explaining sex prevalence differences. In conclusion, our study suggests olfactory testing may help diagnose cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to understand the connection between OPD, aging, and other diseases and to examine olfactory performance in screening individuals at risk of Parkinson's disease and similar conditions.",

Monoallelic SPTAN1 mutations cause various inherited neurological diseases, including spastic paraplegia 91 (SPG91), a type of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). We reported two patients with SPG91 caused by the SPTAN1 mutation c.55\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009T (p.Arg19Trp), who presented with lower limb spasticity and polyneuropathy. An analysis of the patients reported in the literature in addition to the present patients revealed that SPTAN1 p.Arg19Trp was specific for an HSP phenotype, with 35% of the combined patients with sensory\u2012motor polyneuropathy and 30% with cerebellar ataxia. In computational simulations, this variant was predicted to perturb the stability of \u03b1II/\u03b2 spectrin heterotetramerization but did not destabilize the tetramerization domain of \u03b1II-spectrin. Our findings on genotype\u2012phenotype correlations and genetic effects on molecular characteristics may provide important insights into the exploration of \u03b1II-spectrin-related neurological diseases.",

      "title": "Molecular Determinants of A9 Dopaminergic Neurons.",
      "abstract": "In the human brain, the nigrostriatal pathway regulates motor functions, and its selective deterioration leads to the onset of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction and significant disability. The A9 neurons, a subgroup of ventral mesencephalic dopaminergic (DA) neurons, form the nigrostriatal pathway that emerges from the nigral region and innervates into the striatum. These DA neurons exhibit extensive and arborized axonal terminals projecting into the dorsal striatum. This review examines the distinct molecular determinants underlying the development, projection pattern, survival, maintenance, and vulnerability of A9 neurons, distinguishing them from other ventral midbrain DA subgroups such as A8 and A10. Key transcription factors (e.g., Lmx1a/b, FoxA2, Pitx3), signaling cascade pathways (e.g., Sonic Hedgehog, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin), and molecular markers (e.g., Aldh1a1, GIRK2, ANT2) are discussed in detail. A comparative assessment of the electrophysiology, cytoarchitecture, energy demand, and antioxidant reserves of A9 DA neurons versus the neighboring ventral mesencephalic DA subgroups elucidates the role of intrinsic determinants in susceptibility and selective degeneration in PD. The unique susceptibility of A9 cells to redox imbalance, neuronal inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction is also explored. Furthermore, recent advancements in stem cell-based approaches for generating A9-like neurons and their application in cell transplantation therapies for PD are discussed. Current challenges, including integration and long-term survival of transplanted neurons, are highlighted alongside prospects of cell replacement therapy. By evaluating the molecular biology of A9 neurons, this review aims to understand PD pathology and develop strategies for novel therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammation. The transcription factor NF-\u03baB1 is implicated in both neuroprotective and pro-inflammatory processes, with its activity varying between neurons and glial cells. While previous studies have explored the genetic and epigenetic contributions to these diseases, the infection hypothesis has re-emerged as a potential framework for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We conducted bulk RNA sequencing on human postmortem caudate nucleus tissue samples obtained from cognitively normal controls (<i>n</i> = 5), AD patients (<i>n</i> = 6), and PD patients (<i>n</i> = 3). Differential gene expression analysis and pathway enrichment were performed to identify dysregulated signaling mechanisms relevant to neuroinflammation and mitochondrial function. TNF\u03b1 signaling through the NF-\u03baB pathway was identified as a prominently dysregulated mechanism in both AD and PD samples. Transcript levels of NFE2L2 (NRF2) and NF-\u03baB1 were elevated, coinciding with reduced expression of the mitochondrial transporter gene SLC25A6, suggesting a compensatory response to oxidative stress. Additionally, PLCG2 expression was markedly increased in microglial populations, reflecting heightened immune activation. A significant 10-fold reduction in hemoglobin subunit alpha (HbA1) RNA was observed in disease groups compared to controls, indicating compromised oxygen transport and cellular stress. These findings highlight candidate biomarkers and suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial integrity and neuroinflammation may be effective in AD and PD.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria play crucial roles in energy production, metabolism regulation, and cell death. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with many diseases, including cancers, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, developing methods for mitochondrial regulation and treating related diseases has garnered significant interest in biological and medical research. Here, a smart framework nucleic acid (FNA) strategy is presented for mitochondrial interference and targeted cell elimination. Our approach involves the design of tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) modified with triphenylphosphine and single-stranded DNA sequences responding to specific nucleic acid biomarkers (e.g., microRNAs) presented in target cells. The interlinked DNA networks, formed in situ responding to specific biomarkers, enable targeting and enveloping of the mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction. It is demonstrated that TDN-based FNAs targeted the cancer-associated microRNA (miR-21) may enhance the efficacy of cancer therapy by disrupting mitochondrial function, while also serving as carriers of anti-cancer drugs to reduce the side effects. Additionally, FNAs targeting the senescence-associated microRNA (miR-34a) specifically eliminate senescent cells in both cell and Caenorhabditis elegans models, thereby improving overall cell viability within mixed cell populations. This programmable and functionalized TDN-based platform opens new avenues for advancing anti-aging research and treating various diseases by achieving targeted cell elimination through mitochondrial interference.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies emphasize the significance of copper dyshomeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, thereby highlighting the role of copper in neurotoxicity. Cuproptosis, a novel mechanism of copper-dependent cell death, remains underexplored, particularly concerning environmental pollutants like polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs). While PS-NPs are recognized for inducing neurotoxicity through various forms of cell death, including apoptosis and ferroptosis, their potential to trigger neuronal cuproptosis has not yet been investigated. This study aims to determine whether exposure to PS-NPs induces neurotoxicity via cuproptosis and to explore the preliminary molecular mechanisms involved, thereby addressing this significant knowledge gap. Seven-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to PS-NPs at dose of 12.5\u00a0mg/kg, and were co-treated with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Complementary in vitro experiments were conducted using SH-SY5Y neuronal cells exposed to PS-NPs at a concentration of 0.75\u00a0mg/mL, with interventions that included the copper chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), NAC, and the MAPK inhibitor PD98059. Exposure to PS-NPs significantly increased cerebral copper accumulation (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and induced cuproptosis, characterized by lipid-acylated DLAT oligomerization, dysregulation of cuproptosis regulators (FDX1, LIAS, HSP70), and mitochondrial damage. In murine models, PS-NPs elicited neurotoxicity, as evidenced by neuronal loss, decreased Nissl body density, impaired synaptic plasticity, and suppressed oxidative stress markers (GSH, SOD, Nrf2), alongside activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway, ultimately resulting in deficits in learning and memory. Treatment with NAC alleviated these adverse effects. In SH-SY5Y cells, exposure to PS-NPs resulted in reduced cell viability (p\u2009<\u20090.01), an effect that was mitigated by TTM. Furthermore, NAC and PD98059 were found to reverse elevated copper levels, cuproptosis markers, and mitochondrial anomalies (p\u2009<\u20090.05). This study presents preliminary evidence indicating that PS-NPs may induce neuronal cuproptosis, potentially through the oxidative stress-mediated activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway, which contributes to cognitive dysfunction in mice. These findings provide insights into the potential mechanisms underlying PS-NPs neurotoxicity and highlight possible therapeutic targets, such as copper chelation or MAPK inhibition, for mitigating the neurological risks associated with nanoplastic exposure, pending further validation in human-relevant models.",

      "abstract": "To characterize the clinical and myo-fascial histopathological features, along with long-term treatment outcomes of patients with eosinophilic fasciitis (EF). We performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical, serological, myo-fascial pathological features, as well as the long-term follow-up outcomes of EF patients between January 2011 and August 2023 at our neuromuscular disorder (NMD) center. Seventeen patients were included, and a male predominance (12/17, 70.6%) was identified. The most common clinical manifestation was skin thickening (100%), always distal to the elbow and knee joints, occupied by limited joint mobility (12/17, 70.6%). The \"prayer sign\" was observed in 7 (41.2%) patients. Eosinophilia was identified in only 7 (41.2%) patients, including 6 in the blood and 3 in tissue. Anti-Ha antibody was confirmed in one patient (P17). Typical fascial edema with or without involvement of the adjacent subcutaneous tissues was exhibited on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in all 9 patients. The perifascicular pattern of MHC-I and/or MHC-II upregulation without MxA expression was identified in 56.3% (9/16) of the patients' muscle specimens. Typical perifascicular atrophy was identified in 4 patients. Complete recovery was noted in 5 patients, including 4 patients treated with prednisone as monotherapy, and 1 patient treated with prednisone combined with D-penicillamine. The \"prayer sign\" might be an important clinical feature of EF. Perifascicular upregulation of MHC-I and/or MHC-II but negative expression of MxA, with or without PFA, represents a unique pathological phenotype of EF. Most patients show favorable outcome following steroid monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressants, underscoring the autoimmune pathogenic nature of this disease.",

      "abstract": "Neuronal primary cilia, vital for signaling and cell-cycle regulation, have been implicated in maintaining neuronal identity. While a link between primary ciliary defects and neurodegenerative diseases is emerging, the precise pathological mechanisms remain unclear. We studied the genetic contribution of NEK1 to ALS pathogenesis by analyzing the exome sequences of 920 Korean patients with ALS. To understand the disease contribution of NEK1 variants in ALS, we performed a series of functional studies using patient fibroblasts focusing on primary cilia and microtubule-related phenotypes. In addition, these findings were validated in iPSC-derived motor neurons (iPSC-MNs). NIMA-related kinase 1 (NEK1), a gene encoding a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, has been identified as a risk gene for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we report that mutations in NEK1 cause primary ciliary abnormality, cell cycle re-entry, and disrupted tubulin acetylation in ALS. We analyzed the whole-exome sequences of 920 Korean patients with sporadic ALS and identified 16 NEK1 variants in 23 patients. We found that two novel variants, p.E853Rfs*9 and p.M1?, reduced NEK1 expression, resulting in loss-of-function (LOF) and one synonymous splicing variant (p.Q132=) exhibited an aberrant isoform lacking exon 5. All three NEK1 variants exhibited abnormal primary ciliary structure, impaired sonic hedgehog signaling, and altered cell-cycle progression. Furthermore, the ALS-linked variants induced intracellular calcium overload followed by Aurora kinase A (AurA)-histone deacetylase (HDAC)6 activation, resulting in ciliary disassembly. These defects were restored by treatment with the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator, BAPTA. We also found that NEK1 variants cause decreased \u03b1-tubulin acetylation, mitochondrial alteration, and impaired DNA damage response (DDR). Notably, drug treatment to inhibit HDAC6 restored the NEK1-dependent deficits in patient fibroblasts. And, we confirmed that data found in patient fibroblasts were reproduced in iPSC-MNs model. Our results suggest that NEK1 contributes to ALS pathogenesis through the LOF mechanism, and HDAC6 inhibition provides an attractive therapeutic strategy for NEK1 variants associated ALS treatment.",

      "abstract": "Mutations in FUS and TARDBP cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the precise mechanisms of selective motor neuron degeneration remain unresolved. To address if pathomechanisms are shared across mutations and related to either gain- or loss-of-function, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing across isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuron types, harbouring FUS\u00a0P525L, FUS\u00a0R495X, TARDBP\u00a0M337V mutations or FUS knockout. Transcriptional changes were far more pronounced in motor neurons than interneurons. About 20% of uniquely dysregulated motor neuron transcripts were shared across FUS mutations, half from gain-of-function. Most indicated mitochondrial impairments, with attenuated pathways shared with mutant TARDBP M337V as well as C9orf72-ALS patient motor neurons. Mitochondrial motility was impaired in ALS motor axons, even with nuclear localized FUS mutants, demonstrating shared toxic gain-of-function mechanisms across FUS- and TARDBP-ALS, uncoupled from protein mislocalization. These early mitochondrial dysfunctions unique to motor neurons may affect survival and represent therapeutic targets in ALS.",

      "abstract": "Disruption of receptor-mediated mitophagy contributes to neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chuanxiong-Danggui herb pair (CDHP) is classic herbal pair applied to treating neurodegenerative diseases including AD, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease. Though studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of CDHP, the underlying mechanisms by which CDHP attenuates neuronal impairment of AD remains to be elucidated. The objective of this work was to investigate the anti-AD mechanism of CDHP in APP/PS1 mice. Behavioral assessments were conducted on C57BL/6J and APP/PS1 mice following CDHP treatment, alongside an evaluation of neuronal morphology in the hippocampal region. In vitro, HT-22\u00a0cells were induced by A\u03b2<sub>25-35</sub> before being treated with CDHP. The mechanisms of CDHP were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, Golgi staining, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis. Results from the passive avoidance test and the Morris water maze (MWM) indicated that CDHP significantly mitigated cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice, accompanied by a reduction of pathological damage in the CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampus. Further testing found that a significant reduction in dendritic spines density was rescued by CDHP. Synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) were elevated in the CDHP group, while \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques deposition was significantly reduced. Simultaneously, CDHP markedly inhibited neuronal apoptosis through a decrease of the levels of Cleaved Caspase-12 and enhanced expression of Bcl-2/Bax, both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, CDHP improved mitochondrial morphology and function in the AD model by decreasing abnormal mitochondria and increasing the expression of COXIV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that clear mitophagy-autophagosomes were nearly absent in APP/PS1 mice, while the expression of p62 and LC3B were elevated following CDHP treatment. Furthermore, CDHP increased the expression of the FUNDC1 and PGAM5 in APP/PS1 mice and AD-like cell models. These findings suggest that CDHP mitigated cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice by enhancing mitophagy to reduce neuronal injury.",

Among them, the \"minor\" cannabinoid, cannabinol (CBN), has emerged as a promising neuroprotective agent, acting independently of classical cannabinoid receptors through as-yet unidentified mitochondrial targets. To uncover the molecular basis of its neuroprotective effects, we designed and synthesized a chemical probe based on CBN, incorporating a minimalist diazirine linker. Functional assays confirmed that the probe retains CBN's mitochondrial activity and exhibits strong mitochondrial enrichment, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and click-correlative light and electron microscopy (click-CLEM). By affinity-based protein profiling (AfBPP), we identified isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) as a key mitochondrial target of CBN. This finding was further substantiated by siRNA knockdown studies, which revealed that the absence of IDH2 partially phenocopies CBN's effects, validating its role as a critical mediator of CBN's neuroprotective activity.",

      "abstract": "Interest is growing in the potential role of manganese (Mn) in Alzheimer's Disease (ADRD). This nested pilot study of a ferroalloy workers cohort was aimed to investigate the effects of long-term occupational Mn exposure on cognitive function through \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) modification and brain deposition, as well as metabolomic, lipidomic and proteomic profiling. We examined 6 male exposed workers (median age 63, exposure duration 31 yrs), and 5 historical controls (median age 60) who had undergone brain PET scan imaging showing higher A\u03b2 deposition among the exposed compared to the controls (p < 0.05). The average annual cumulative respirable Mn of the ferroalloy workers was 329.23 \u00b1 516.39 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> (geometric mean 118.59). Average Mn level in plasma of the exposed subjects (0.704 \u00b1 0.2 ng/mL) was significantly higher than the controls (0.397 \u00b1 0.18). Pathway analyses using LC-MS/MS results revealed impacted metabolomic pathways such as olfactory signaling, mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, biogenic amine synthesis, SLC-mediated transmembrane transport, and glycerophospholipid and choline metabolism in the Mn exposed group. Single molecule arrays (Simoa) analysis revealed notable modifications of AD-related plasma biomarkers; protein microarray (chip) showed significant changes (p < 0.05) in the levels of some plasma antibodies targeting autoimmune and neuronal associated proteins such as A\u03b2 (25-35), GFAP, Serotonin, Human NOVA1, and Human Siglec-1/CD169 among the Mn exposed individuals. This data provides evidence on Mn-induced alterations of pathways and biomarkers associated with cognitive neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that causes a substantial decline in cognitive functions and affects memory, thinking abilities, and daily behavior. The most prominent hallmark of AD pathogenesis is the formation of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, among other associated pathways such as neurofibrillary tangles, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), an acetylcholine-degrading enzyme, plays a critical role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease, particularly through its involvement in amyloid-\u03b2 plaque formation. Thus, the inhibition of BuChE is considered a valuable therapeutic strategy for the management of AD. The present study aimed to identify potential bioactive chemicals from naturally occurring dietary compounds that could improve neurocognitive function and appear as a viable treatment for AD by inhibiting the function of BuChE. A small library of 44 natural dietary chemicals from a variety of dietary plants was subjected to comprehensive in silico studies, including molecular docking, molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations, pharmacokinetics assessments, toxicity profiles, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and density functional theory (DFT) analysis. These studies revealed that CID 129886986 and CID 115269 showed stronger binding affinities with drug-likeness and no toxicity than the FDA-approved standard drug, Donepezil. Additionally, they exhibited strong structural stability with fewer fluctuations throughout the simulation, making them promising candidates for Alzheimer's disease treatment.",

      "abstract": "For more than a century, hypercholesterolemia has been linked to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Notably, this metabolic condition has also been pointed out as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oxidative stress seems to be the connective factor between hypercholesterolemia and cardio and neurological disorders. By disturbing redox homeostasis, hypercholesterolemia impairs nitric oxide (NO) availability, an essential vasoprotective element, and jeopardizes endothelial function and selective permeability. The central nervous system (CNS) is partially protected from peripheral insults due to an arrangement between endothelial cells, astrocytes, microglia, and pericytes that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The endothelial dysfunction related to hypercholesterolemia increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and also initiates BBB breakdown, which is a cause of brain damage characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and, ultimately, neuronal and synaptic impairment. In this regard, we reviewed the mechanisms by which hypercholesterolemia-induced oxidative stress affects peripheral vessels, BBB, and leads to memory deficits. Finally, we suggest oxidative stress as the missing link between hypercholesterolemia and dementia.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a severe global health problem accompanied by persistent low mood that harms the physical and mental health of people and places a substantial economic burden on society. Mangiferin (MGF), a natural polyphenol in the traditional Chinese herb Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge., can improve neuronal damage, memory, and cognitive deficits, implicating the therapeutic potential of MGF for depression. MGF has a unique C-glycosyl and phenolic structure that endows it with multiple biological properties, e.g., anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the pharmacological role of MGF in depression remains unclear. Therefore, this review describes the neuroprotective effects and the antidepressant mechanisms of MGF in preclinical depression studies. MGF ameliorates cognitive deficits in depression and neurodegenerative diseases animal models by reducing amyloid-beta deposition, ameliorating cholinergic dysfunction, and increasing neurotrophic factors. Also, MGF regulates molecular mechanisms in depressed animals mainly through anti-inflammation (by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and its downstream nuclear factor-\u043aB signaling pathway, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity), anti-oxidant (by increasing levels of anti-oxidant enzymes and inhibiting lipid peroxidation). Notably, the potential mechanisms of MGF in treating depression by modulating neurotransmission (e.g., glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) need to be further explored. It is hoped to explore further the potential molecular mechanisms of MGF's biological activity in depression and provide directions for further clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (GCI/R) induces widespread neuronal degeneration, accompanied by tauopathy in the hippocampus and profound cognitive impairment. Tau, a microtubule-associated protein highly expressed in neurons, becomes neurotoxic upon hyperphosphorylation, disrupting mitochondrial integrity and destabilizing microtubule architecture. Despite extensive efforts, no practical therapeutic approach has emerged to counter tau-related pathology. This study established a murine GCI/R model using three cycles of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (5\u00a0min per cycle) with 5-min reperfusion intervals. The presence of cis P-tau and cognitive deficits in the hippocampus was confirmed following GCI/R. Treatment with a cis P-tau-targeted monoclonal antibody effectively prevented cognitive deterioration and attenuated ultrastructural brain damage. These findings demonstrate that GCI/R promotes pathogenic tau formation and contributes to cognitive dysfunction. Targeting cis P-tau may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to mitigate neurodegeneration and support cognitive recovery following global cerebral ischemic injury.",

      "title": "Berberine can be a Potential Therapeutic Agent in Treatment of Huntington's Disease: A Proposed Mechanistic Insight.",
      "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, producing mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. This leads to neuronal damage through protein aggregation, transcriptional dysregulation, excitotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. mHTT impairs protein clearance and alters gene expression, energy metabolism, and synaptic function. Therapeutic strategies include enhancing mHTT degradation, gene silencing via antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi, promoting neuroprotection through BDNF signaling, and modulating neurotransmitters like glutamate and dopamine. Berberine, a natural isoquinoline alkaloid, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for HD due to its multifaceted neuroprotective properties. Research indicates that berberine can mitigate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including HD, by targeting various molecular pathways. It exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and autophagy-enhancing effects, which are crucial in reducing neuronal damage and apoptosis associated with HD. These properties make berberine a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in HD, as demonstrated in both cellular and animal models. Berberine activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is vital for cell survival and neuroprotection. It reduces oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, both of which are implicated in HD pathology. Berberine enhances autophagic processes, promoting the degradation of mutant huntingtin protein, a key pathological feature of HD. In transgenic HD mouse models, berberine administration has been shown to alleviate motor dysfunction and prolong survival. It effectively reduces the accumulation of mutant huntingtin in cultured cells, suggesting a direct impact on the disease's molecular underpinnings. Berberine's safety profile, established through its use in treating other conditions, supports its potential for clinical trials in HD patients. Its ability to modulate neurotransmitter levels and engage multiple signaling pathways further underscores its therapeutic promise. While berberine shows significant potential as a therapeutic agent for HD, further research is necessary to fully elucidate its mechanisms and optimize its clinical application. The current evidence in the review paper, primarily from preclinical studies, provides a strong foundation for future investigations into berberine's efficacy and safety in human HD patients.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and one of the world's fastest-growing neurological diseases. Although the exact causes of PD are unknown, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation may have significant roles in disease progression. As well as being prevalent in the brain, there is also evidence that peripheral mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation occur in PD. However, if/how peripheral mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation are linked is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the extent that mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral immune cells is associated with inflammation in PD. The study comprised of 35 controls and 35 PD patients that were age and sex matched. Flow cytometry was used to assess mitochondrial content and superoxide production in mononuclear cells, in the presence and absence of the mitochondrial stressor antimycin A. Serum inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. Superoxide levels were significantly increased in PD patient mononuclear cells at baseline, and PD mononuclear cells had an impaired response to antimycin A. Immune cell superoxide levels correlated with serum cytokines associated with T-cell responses, namely interleukin (IL) IL-12, interferon-\u03b3, and IL-17A. Results show that mitochondrial dysfunction is prevalent in PD immune cells and may contribute to an inflammatory phenotype. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 1 (NFE2L1) has emerged as a key regulator of proteostasis, integrating proteasome function, autophagy, and ferroptosis to counteract oxidative stress and protein misfolding. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of NFE2L1 in maintaining neuronal homeostasis, focusing on its mechanisms for mitigating proteotoxic stress and supporting cellular health, offering protection against neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we discuss the pathological implications of NFE2L1 dysfunction and explore its potential as a therapeutic target. By highlighting gaps in the current understanding and presenting future research directions, this review aims to elucidate NFE2L1's role in advancing treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "There are more and more Alzheimer's patients. The formation of plaques of A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> in the brain is one of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease. Corn oligopeptides have natural antioxidant effects. It is aimed to develop functional corn oligopeptides to prevent Alzheimer's disease through antioxidation. According to previous laboratory studies, peptides of corn oligopeptides were screened by biological activity score and ADMET prediction, and molecular docking technology was used to screen the peptides that had high binding energy with A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>. The protective effects of the selected peptides were evaluated against oxidative stress in A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-injured SHSY5Y cells, and the mechanism of the effects in the protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated signaling pathway was investigated, which is closely related to neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. The results showed that three peptides (GL, FA and FQ) significantly increased the cell viability of A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced cells and mitochondrial intensity and decreased extracellular lactate dehydrogenase content. They also improved intracellular oxidative stress caused by A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>, including reducing the overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and increasing the content of lipid oxidation, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In addition, western blot showed that treatment with GL, FA and FQ significantly increased the expression of PKA, CREB and BDNF, whereas cells injured with A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> decreased the expression of these signaling proteins. These results suggest that peptides of corn oligopeptides can effectively improve A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced Alzheimer's disease, and may improve oxidative stress response to protective nerve cells by up-regulating the protein expression of the PKA/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway. \u00a9 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

      "abstract": "Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) is a rare neurological disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of Guanine-Adenine-Adenine (GAA) repeat in intron 1 of the <i>FXN</i> gene, which encodes frataxin, leading to reduced expression of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein essential for cellular homeostasis. Frataxin deficiency results in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired redox balance. Currently, there is no cure for FRDA. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of antioxidants dimethyl fumarate (DMF), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and L-ascorbic acid (LAA) in restoring mitochondrial redox homeostasis and frataxin levels in FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts and 2D sensory neurons. We assessed cell viability, mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial DNA copy number, mitochondrial membrane potential, and frataxin and NRF2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels following antioxidant treatment, either individually or in combination. Treatment with LAA, NAC, and DMF resulted in significant reductions in mitochondrial and cellular ROS, along with increased FXN and NRF2 expression, and enhanced NRF2 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, these compounds improved aconitase/citrate synthase activity, GSH/GSSG ratios, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Notably, the combination of LAA and NAC consistently alleviated multiple disease-associated defects in FRDA cells, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic approach.",

      "title": "Metabolomics: a new frontier in neurodegenerative disease biomarker discovery.",
      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are a group of debilitating diseases affecting the central nervous system, and are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, leading to declines in cognitive function, movement, and overall quality of life. While the exact causes remain elusive, it's believed that a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors contribute to their development. Metabolites, the end products of cellular processes, reflect the physiological state of an organism. By analysing these molecules, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying metabolic changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders. This review aims to explore the possibilities between metabolites and their association with neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Huntington's disease (HD). Metabolomic studies could potentially illuminate altered biochemical pathways, facilitating earlier detection and treatment of these conditions. Metabolomic investigations have revealed the role of oxidative stress, alterations in glucose and fat metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, glutamate excitotoxicity and alterations in myelin composition in neurodegenerative disorders. The common metabolic biomarkers identified includes glutamate, taurine, uric acid, branched chain amino acids, acylcarnitine, creatinine, choline, with some more amino acids and lipids. Metabolomics offers valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets by identifying biochemical and metabolic alterations, but still there are several aspects to be explored for accurate mapping of metabolites with specific pathway involved in the disease.",

      "abstract": "Aging is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the aging brain shares many characteristics with the early stages of AD. This study investigates the interplay between aging and amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) induced pathology. We developed an AD-like <i>in vivo</i> model, using the stereotactic injection of A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers into the hippocampi of aged mice. Cognitive impairments were assessed using a Y maze. Immunohistochemical and protein analyses were conducted to evaluate neuronal survival, synaptic function and number, levels of tau hyperphosphorylation, microglial activation, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. We compared baseline aging effects in young adult (3 months) and aged (16-18 months) healthy mice. We found that aged mice displayed significant deficits in working memory, synaptic density and neurogenesis, and an increased basal inflammation. In response to acute injury to the hippocampus with A\u03b2 oligomer injection, aged mice suffered sustained deficits, including impaired cognitive function, further reduced neurogenesis and synaptic density, increased microglial activation, astrogliosis, mitochondrial stress, and lysosomal burden. Furthermore, in the weeks following injury, the aged mice show increased amyloid accumulation, microglial activation and phosphorylated tau propagation, expanding from the injection site to adjacent hippocampal regions. In contrast, the young adult mice exhibited only acute effects without long-term progression of pathology or neurodegeneration. We conclude that the aging brain environment increases susceptibility to an acute A\u03b2 injury, creating fertile soil for the progression of AD, whereas younger brains are able to overcome this injury. The processes of aging should be considered as an integral factor in the development of the disease. Targeting aging mechanisms may provide new strategies for AD prevention and treatment, as well as for other neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Neurological disorders, including brain cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic/reperfusion injury, pose a significant threat to global human health. Due to the high metabolic demands of nerve cells, mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical feature of these disorders. The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) is an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial response, which is critical for maintaining mitochondrial and energetic homeostasis under stress. Previous studies have found that UPR<sup>mt</sup> participates in diverse physiological processes especially metabolism and immunity. Currently, increasing evidence suggest that targeted regulation of UPR<sup>mt</sup> can also effectively delay the progression of neurological diseases and improve patients' prognosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of UPR<sup>mt</sup> in the context of neurological diseases, with a particular emphasis on its regulatory functions. Additionally, we summarize the mechanistic insights into UPR<sup>mt</sup> in neurological disorders as investigated in preclinical studies, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target in the clinical management of neurological tumors. By highlighting the importance of UPR<sup>mt</sup> in the complex processes underlying neurological disorders, this review aims to bridge current knowledge gaps and inspire novel therapeutic strategies for these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial heterogeneity drives diverse cellular responses in neurodegenerative diseases, complicating the evaluation of mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we describe a high-throughput imaging and analysis approach to investigate cell-to-cell mitochondrial variability. We applied known mitochondrial function inhibitors - rotenone, antimycin, and oligomycin to inhibit complexes I, III, and V (ATP synthase) function in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons, a model commonly used in neurodegenerative disease research. We captured a large number of cell images and extracted a diverse range of mitochondrial morphological features related to shape, size, texture, and spatial distribution, for an unbiased and comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial morphology. Group-level cell analysis, which examines the collective responses of cells exposed to the same mitochondrial inhibitor, showed that cells treated with rotenone, antimycin, or oligomycin clustered together based on their shared morphological changes. Rotenone and antimycin, both targeting different complexes of the electron transport chain, formed sub-clusters within a larger cluster. In contrast, oligomycin, which inhibits ATP synthase, resulted in a distinct cluster likely due to its differing effect on ATP production. Single-cell analysis using dimensionality reduction techniques revealed distinct subpopulations of cells with varying degrees of sensitivity to each mitochondrial inhibitor, identifying the most affected cells. Mitochondrial feature differential expression analysis showed that neurite-related mitochondrial features, such as intensity and size, were more severely impacted than cell body-related mitochondrial features, particularly with rotenone and antimycin, which target the electron transport chain. In contrast, oligomycin which affects ATP synthesis by directly inhibiting ATP synthase showed relatively less severe alterations in neurite-related mitochondrial features, highlighting a distinct effect of the mode of action between inhibitors. By incorporating the most affected cells into machine learning models, we significantly improved the prediction accuracy of mitochondrial dysfunction outcomes -\u200981.97% for antimycin, 75.12% for rotenone, and 94.42% for oligomycin. This enhancement underscores the value of targeting highly responsive cell subpopulations, offering a more precise method for evaluating mitochondrial modulators and therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized transmembrane protein. STING induces the type I interferon and inflammatory responses against a variety of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, which is critical to limiting their infection and replication. In certain settings where self-DNAs (genomic or mitochondrial DNA) emerge in the cytosol or the intracellular membrane traffic is impaired, STING becomes activated and triggers inflammation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of various autoinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases including COPA syndrome and Parkinson's disease. The human STING gene holds genetic heterogeneity with R232, HAQ (R71H-G230A-R293Q), and H232 being the most common variants, and population stratification. A very recent study has shown that HAQ, not R232 or H232, mediates completely clinical protection in the pathogenesis of COPA syndrome. These results reveal, for the first time, the distinct activities of the major variants in the context of pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases. Besides these major variants, there exist minor pathogenic STING variants that cause an autoinflammatory disease called STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). This review summarizes recent insights into human STING variants and their inflammatory activities.Key words: innate immunity, STING variants, COPA syndrome, membrane traffic, the Golgi.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial metabolism in neurons is necessary for energetically costly processes like synaptic transmission and plasticity. As post-mitotic cells, neurons are therefore faced with the challenge of maintaining healthy functioning mitochondria throughout lifetime. The precise mechanisms of mitochondrial maintenance in neurons, and particularly in morphologically complex dendrites and axons, are not fully understood. Evidence from several biological systems suggests the regulation of cellular metabolism by extracellular vesicles (EVs), secretory lipid-enclosed vesicles that have emerged as important mediators of cell communication. In the nervous system, neuronal and glial EVs were shown to regulate neuronal circuit development and function, at least in part via the transfer of protein and RNA cargo. Interestingly, EVs have been implicated in diseases characterized by altered metabolism, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, nervous system EVs were shown to contain proteins related to metabolic processes, mitochondrial proteins and even intact mitochondria. Here, we present the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying neuronal mitochondrial maintenance, and highlight recent evidence suggesting the regulation of synaptic mitochondria by neuronal and glial cell EVs. We further discuss the potential implications of EV-mediated regulation of mitochondrial maintenance and function in neuronal circuit development and synaptic plasticity.",

      "title": "Molecular Links Between Circadian Rhythm Disruption, Melatonin, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Updated Review.",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are molecular oscillations governed by transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) operating in nearly all cell types and are fundamental to physiological homeostasis. Key circadian regulators, such as circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (<i>BMAL1</i>), period (<i>PER</i>), and cryptochrome (<i>CRY</i>) gene families, regulate intracellular metabolism, oxidative balance, mitochondrial function, and synaptic plasticity. Circadian disruption is known as a central contributor to the molecular pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Disease-specific disruptions in clock gene expression and melatoninergic signaling are known as potential early-stage molecular biomarkers. Melatonin, a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland, modulates clock gene expression, mitochondrial stability, and inflammatory responses. It also regulates epigenetic and metabolic processes through nuclear receptors and metabolic regulators involved in circadian and cellular stress pathways, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects and maintaining neuronal integrity. This review provides recent findings from the past five years, highlighting how circadian dysregulation mediates key molecular and cellular disturbances and the translational potential of circadian-based therapies in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are multifactorial disorders frequently associated with gut dysbiosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. <b>Methods:</b> Using untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and 16S sequencing of human stool, we investigated bacterial and metabolic dyshomeostasis in the gut microbiome associated with early disease stages across three NDDs-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD)-and healthy controls (HC). <b>Results</b>: We discovered a previously unrecognized link between a microbial-derived metabolite with an unknown role in human physiology, 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS), and gut dysbiosis in NDDs. DHPS was downregulated in AD, ALS, and PD, while bacteria involved in DHPS metabolism, <i>Eubacterium</i> and <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, were increased in all disease cohorts. Additionally, select taxa within the Clostridia class had strong negative correlations to DHPS, suggesting a potential role in DHPS metabolism. A catabolic product of DHPS is hydrogen sulfide, and when in excess, it is known to promote inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and gut dysbiosis, known hallmarks of NDDs. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings suggest that cryptic sulfur metabolism via DHPS is a potential missing link in our current understanding of gut dysbiosis associated with NDD onset and progression. As this was a hypothesis generating study, more work is needed to elucidate the role of DHPS in gut dysbiosis and neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder lacking effective disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we integrated large-scale protein-protein interaction networks with a multi-modal graph neural network (GNN) to identify and prioritize multi-target drug repurposing candidates for PD. Network analysis and advanced clustering methods delineated functional modules, and a novel Functional Centrality Index was employed to pinpoint key nodes within the PD interactome. The GNN model, incorporating molecular descriptors, network topology, and uncertainty quantification, predicted candidate drugs that simultaneously target critical proteins implicated in lysosomal dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, synaptic disruption, and neuroinflammation. Among the top hits were compounds such as dithiazanine, ceftolozane, DL-\u03b1-tocopherol, bromisoval, imidurea, medronic acid, and modufolin. These findings provide mechanistic insights into PD pathology and demonstrate that a polypharmacology approach can reveal repurposing opportunities for existing drugs. Our results highlight the potential of network-based deep learning frameworks to accelerate the discovery of multi-target therapies for PD and other multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis, contributing to increased oxidative stress and impaired endo-lysosomal-proteasome system efficiency underlying neuronal injury. Genetic studies have identified 19 monogenic mutations-accounting for ~10% of PD cases-that affect mitochondrial function and are associated with early- or late-onset PD. Early-onset forms typically involve genes encoding proteins essential for mitochondrial quality control, including mitophagy and structural maintenance, while late-onset mutations impair mitochondrial dynamics, bioenergetics, and trafficking. Atypical juvenile genetic syndromes also exhibit mitochondrial abnormalities. In idiopathic PD, environmental neurotoxins such as pesticides and MPTP act as mitochondrial inhibitors, disrupting complex I activity and increasing reactive oxygen species. These converging pathways underscore mitochondria as a central node in PD pathology. This review explores the overlapping and distinct mitochondrial mechanisms in genetic and non-genetic PD, emphasizing their role in neuronal vulnerability. Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction finally offers a promising therapeutic avenue to slow or modify disease progression by intervening at a key point of neurodegenerative convergence.",

      "abstract": "<i>Hemerocallis citrina</i> is an herbaceous perennial plant used in Asian cuisine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Here, we tested the therapeutic potential of extracts (HCE30%, HCE50%, and HCN) in vivo, using models of two human genetic neurodegenerative diseases-Machado-Joseph Disease/Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (MJD/SCA3) and Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism associated to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Chronic treatment with HCE30% extract ameliorated the motor deficits typically observed in these models. Interestingly, we found that the effect on the motor phenotype of the MJD/SCA3 model was dependent on serotonergic signaling and on the action of the HLH-30/TFEB transcription factor, known to regulate the cellular response to amino acid starvation, the autophagy and mitophagy pathways, lysosome localization and biogenesis, exocytosis, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Altogether, our findings reinforce the idea that phytochemicals act through the modulation of serotonergic neurotransmission and introduce a novel layer to the HLH-30/TFEB regulatory network. Thus, it also strengthens the use of these pathways as therapeutic targets for protein-related neurodegenerative disorders and confirms the utility of medicinal plants as a source of innovation in the quest for new therapeutic agents.",

      "abstract": "<i>Drosophila</i> has provided a highly attractive model system for studying various tissue- and stage-specific processes as well as their pathologies, including a range of human diseases. The existence of a large number of diverse Gal4 drivers to precisely control the expression patterns of UAS transgenes simplifies such studies. However, the choice of driver is always critical, as its possible ectopic expression in non-target cells and tissues can directly impact the results. Therefore, it is very important to thoroughly characterize both the molecular nature and expression pattern of each Gal4 driver line. Here, we aim to fill such gaps regarding the AB1-Gal4 driver, which is typically used to express UAS transgenes in larval salivary glands. In this fly line, the P{GawB} enhancer trap construct encoding the Gal4 protein resides within overlapping evolutionary conserved <i>spastin</i> (<i>spas</i>) and <i>Mitochondrial Rho</i> (<i>Miro</i>) genes. Both these genes are expressed in a number of tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS), and their human orthologs are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Consistently, we demonstrate that, in third-instar larvae, the expression pattern of AB1-Gal4 is also not restricted to salivary glands. We detect its activity in a subset of Elav-positive neurons in the CNS, including motor neurons, as well as in specific photoreceptor cells in eye discs.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration and associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, present significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment. This review explores the potential of copper(II)-bis(thiosemicarbazone) complexes, particularly Cu-ATSM, as a dual-purpose radiopharmaceutical for imaging and therapeutic interventions. Cu-ATSM exhibits unique redox-dependent retention in pathological microenvironments, driven by mitochondrial dysfunction and hyper-reductive states, which enables the noninvasive detection of oxidative stress via positron emission tomography (PET). Preclinical studies demonstrate its efficacy in mitigating neuroinflammation by suppressing glial activation, reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1), and increasing the expression of neuroprotective metallothionein-1 (MT1). Some Clinical research reveals elevated \u2076\u2074Cu-ATSM uptake in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, correlating with disease severity and regional oxidative stress markers. Furthermore, Cu-ATSM derivatives show promise in modulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, enhancing amyloid-\u03b2 clearance, and restoring copper homeostasis in ALS models. Despite these advances, limitations such as small cohort sizes and heterogeneity in clinical studies underscore the need for larger-scale validation. Multimodal imaging integrating PET and MRI, alongside novel structural analogs targeting A\u03b2 plaques and redox imbalances, emerges as a strategic direction for future research. Collectively, Cu-ATSM represents a transformative tool for elucidating neuropathological mechanisms and advancing therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "The consequences of aging can vary dramatically between different brain regions and cell types. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic neurons develop physiological deficits with normal aging that likely convey susceptibility to neurodegeneration. While nearby GABAergic neurons are thought to be more resilient, decreased GABA signaling in other areas nonetheless correlates with age-related cognitive decline and the development of degenerative diseases. Here, we used two novel cell type-specific translating ribosome affinity purification models to elucidate the impact of healthy brain aging on the molecular profiles of dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral midbrain. By analyzing differential gene expression from young adult (7-10 months) and old (21-24 months) mice, we detected commonalities in the aging process in both neuronal types, including increased inflammatory responses and upregulation of pro-survival pathways. Both cell types also showed downregulation of genes involved in synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Intriguingly, genes involved in serotonergic synthesis were upregulated with age in GABA neurons and not dopamine-releasing cells. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons showed alterations in genes connected with mitochondrial function and calcium signaling, which were markedly downregulated in male mice. Sex differences were detected in both neuron types, but in general were more prominent in dopamine neurons. Multiple sex effects correlated with the differential prevalence for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's seen in humans. In summary, these results provide insight into the connection between non-pathological aging and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases involving the ventral midbrain, and identify molecular phenotypes that could underlie homeostatic maintenance during normal aging.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most debilitating form of dementia, characterized by amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-related toxic mechanisms such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The development of AD is influenced by environmental factors linked to lifestyle, including physical and mental inactivity, diet, and smoking, all of which have been associated with the severity of the disease and A\u03b2-related pathology. In this study, we used differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and C6 glioma cells to investigate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of daidzein, a naturally occurring isoflavone, in the context of A\u03b2 oligomer-related toxicity. We observed that pre-treatment with daidzein prevented A\u03b2-induced cell viability loss, increased oxidative stress, and mitochondrial membrane potential decline in both SH-SY5Y and C6 cells. Furthermore, daidzein application reduced elevated levels of MAPK pathway proteins, pro-inflammatory molecules (cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-1\u03b2), and pyroptosis markers, including caspase-1 and gasdermin D, all of which were increased by A\u03b2 exposure. These findings strongly suggest that daidzein alleviates inflammation and toxicity caused by A\u03b2 oligomers. Our results indicate that daidzein could be a potential therapeutic agent for AD and other A\u03b2-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Therapeutic applications of exercise in neurodegenerative diseases: focusing on the mechanism of SIRT1.",
      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases comprise a group of central nervous system disorders marked by progressive neuronal degeneration and dysfunction. Their pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. Recent research has highlighted the potential of exercise as a non-pharmacological intervention for both the prevention and treatment of these disorders. In particular, exercise has received growing attention for its capacity to upregulate the expression and activity of SIRT1, a critical mediator of neuroprotection via downstream signaling pathways. SIRT1, a key member of the Sirtuin family, is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\u2009+)-dependent class III histone deacetylase. It plays an essential role in regulating cellular metabolism, energy homeostasis, gene expression, and cellular longevity. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, SIRT1 confers neuroprotection by modulating multiple signaling cascades through deacetylation, suppressing neuronal apoptosis, and promoting neural repair and regeneration. Exercise enhances SIRT1 expression and activity by increasing NAD\u2009+\u2009synthesis and utilization, improving intracellular redox balance, alleviating oxidative stress-induced inhibition of SIRT1, and thereby promoting its activation. Moreover, exercise may indirectly modulate SIRT1 function by influencing interacting molecular networks. This review summarizes recent advances in the therapeutic application of exercise for neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on SIRT1 as a central mechanism. It examines how exercise mediates neuroprotection through the regulation of SIRT1 and its associated molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways. Finally, the paper discusses the potential applications and challenges of integrating exercise and SIRT1-targeted strategies in the management of neurodegenerative diseases, offering novel perspectives for the development of innovative treatments and improvements in patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "In this review, we focus on the ultrastructural characteristics of the Golgi membrane-associated degradation (GOMED) pathway, which have been clarified by electron microscopy and highlight recent advances in the elucidation of its molecular mechanism and physiological roles. The discovery of GOMED, an Atg5/Atg7-independent degradation pathway that differs from canonical autophagy in membrane origin, stimuli, and substrate specificity, has substantially expanded our understanding of intracellular degradation systems. In 2009, we identified GOMED as a novel, evolutionarily conserved autophagic pathway and demonstrated its role in intracellular degradation across eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals. We identified the conserved protein Hsv2/Wipi3 as an essential GOMED protein, which translocates to the trans-Golgi upon induction and remodels Golgi membranes into cup-shaped structures that engulf cytoplasmic components for lysosomal degradation. These processes contribute to organelle and secretory granule turnover, as well as mitochondrial clearance during erythroid differentiation. Moreover, neuronal-specific ablation of Wipi3 in mice causes severe cerebellar degeneration, implicating GOMED in tissue development and homeostasis. As these mechanisms are associated with diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, GOMED mechanisms should also be considered when establishing therapeutic strategies for these diseases.",

      "abstract": "The homeostasis of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is crucial for normal brain function. The mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) connects the multifunctional amino acid glutamate, which is intimately related to glutamate metabolism, to the Krebs cycle. As a result, GDH reglutes the synthesis and uptake of the chemical messenger glutamate in neuroendocrine cells, playing a crucial role in the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates. Nonetheless, brain ageing and numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, have been linked to GDH malfunction or dysregulation. In this review, we summarize the dynamics of GDH levels in the ageing brain and provide additional details about the role of GDH in the ageing brain. Understanding the metabolic mechanisms underlying glutamate homeostasis in the aging brain and how GDH regulates glutamate-dependent metabolic processes at synapses may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, potentially slowing the aging process and promoting brain regeneration.",

The balance of mitochondrial quality control is critical for neuronal health, and disruptions in this balance are often implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. Mitochondrial dysfunction not only exacerbates energy deficits but also triggers neuroinflammation through the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review examines the mechanisms and recent advancements in mitochondrial quality control in neurological diseases, focusing on processes such as mitochondrial fusion and fission, mitophagy, biogenesis, and protein expression regulation. It further explores the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent inflammatory cascades in conditions such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. Additionally, emerging research highlights the significance of mitochondrial transfer mechanisms, particularly intercellular transfer between neurons and glial cells, as a potential strategy for mitigating inflammation and promoting cellular repair. This review provides insights into the molecular underpinnings of neuroinflammatory pathologies while underscoring the translational potential of targeting mitochondrial quality control for therapeutic development.",

Growing evidence has also implicated the role of lysosome-related mechanisms in the aging process. Meanwhile, the potential impact of lysosomal dysfunction on the production of inflammatory molecules, cellular metabolic status, and mitochondrial function is becoming increasingly significant. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the physiological roles of lysosomes and their association with aging. At the cellular level, lysosomal dysfunction and cellular senescence show strong correlations. Herein, we elucidated the precise mechanisms by which lysosomal dysfunction contributes to various cellular physiological processes, as well as its potential implications in age-related hallmarks. More importantly, we discuss how lysosomal homeostasis is disrupted in several age-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, heart diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, and motor system diseases. Thus, a deeper understanding of lysosomal function may provide fundamental insights into human physiology and age-related diseases. Furthermore, these discoveries emphasize the role of the lysosome in the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases necessitates the development of novel approaches to study, diagnose, and treat these devastating disorders. Accordingly, there is a critical need to precisely address the gap in the biochemical and physiological mechanisms that underlie neurodegenerative diseases to promote advancements in therapeutic interventions. Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's, demands further research focused on unravelling the rather intricate molecular mechanisms that drive its progression upon different cell signaling cues. While alpha-synuclein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction are two cellular hallmarks of the molecular pathophysiology of PD, few drugs are currently in clinical trials for treatment of PD, which warrants further studies to identify new therapeutic molecular targets. Herein, we briefly highlight some of the reported roles of ferroptosis, a\u00a0modality of cell death that is driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, and its regulation by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). We discuss the interconnectedness between lipid peroxidation and GPX4 regulation in the context of molecular pathogenesis of PD. \u00a0Future studies are imperative in investigating the physiological role of ferroptosis and the translational impact of ferroptosis-specific modulators in studying PD biology.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are membrane-bound cell organelles that undertake the majority of the energetic and metabolic processes within the cell. They are also responsible for mediating multiple apoptotic pathways, balancing redox charges, and scavenging reactive oxygen species. MicroRNAs, which are short, non-coding RNAs widely known for regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, regulate many of these processes. The specific microRNAs that directly or indirectly control mitochondrial dynamics are called mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs). The broadest classification of this type of ncRNA encompasses nuclear-encoded miRNAs that interact with cytoplasmatic mRNAs associated with mitochondrial activity. At the same time, a more specific subset comprises nuclear-encoded miRNAs that translocate into the mitochondria to interact with mRNAs inside of this organelle. Finally, the smallest group of mitomiRs includes those codified by mtDNA and can regulate endogenous mitochondrial transcripts or be transported into the cytoplasm to modulate circulating mRNAs. Regardless of the origin or action mechanism, mitomiRs have been recently recognized to have a key role in the progression of a variety of chronic disorders, such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, asthma, depression, and even cancer. All of these progressive pathologies have been tightly linked to mitochondrial dysregulation. They are further associated with an aberrant expression of specific miRNAs that regulate cellular metabolism, positioning mitomiRs as reliable biomarkers for diagnosing several chronic diseases. These molecular indicators have also provided insights into how these conditions progress, allowing for the development of different miRNA-based treatment strategies that target dysregulated mitochondrial-related genes, reestablishing their baseline activity and restricting further disease progression.",

However, import machineries can become overwhelmed or disrupted by physiological demands, mitochondrial damage or diseases, such as metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. Impaired import affects mitochondrial function and causes un-imported pre-proteins to accumulate not only in the cytosol but also in other compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus. Quality control pathways have evolved to mitigate the accumulation of these mistargeted proteins and prevent proteotoxicity. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we summarize the fate of un-imported mitochondrial proteins and the compartment-specific quality control pathways that regulate them.",

A trans-mitochondrial cybrid cell line derived from a Chinese LHON patient carrying the m.3635G>A, diagnosed at the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University in September 2013, was selected as the study subject. A trans-mitochondrial cybrid cell line from a healthy control with an identical mitochondrial background was included as a control. Immunofluorescence, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blotting were employed to assess the expression of autophagy-related proteins, aiming to explore the role of BNIP3-mediated mitophagy in m.3635G>A related LHON. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Ethics No. 2023-J-096). Compared with the control group, the protein expression levels of autophagy-related markers LC3 (LC3-II/LC3-I) and LAMP1 were significantly reduced in the variant group (P < 0.05). Additionally, the protein levels of macroautophagy-related proteins ATG12, ATG7, and ATG5 were also significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Compared with the control cells, the mRNA and protein expression levels of mitophagy-associated protein BNIP3 were significantly reduced in the cells of the variant group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, both mRNA and protein expression levels of the mitophagy-related protein BNIP3 were significantly reduced in the variant group (P < 0.05). The m.3635G>A inhibits BNIP3-mediated mitophagy, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of LHON.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pose significant challenges due to their complex pathophysiology and lack of effective treatments. Green tea, rich in the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) polyphenolic component, has demonstrated potential as a neuroprotective agent with numerous medicinal applications. EGCG effectively reduces tau and A\u03b2 aggregation in ND models, promotes autophagy, and targets key signaling pathways like Nrf2-ARE, NF-\u03baB, and MAPK. This review explores the molecular processes that underlie EGCG's neuroprotective properties, including its ability to regulate mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and protein misfolding. Clinical research indicates that EGCG may enhance cognitive and motor abilities, potentially inhibiting disease progression despite absorption and dose optimization limitations. The substance has been proven to slow the amyloidogenic process, prevent protein aggregation, decrease amyloid cytotoxicity, inhibit fibrillogenesis, and restructure fibrils for synergistic therapeutic effects. The review highlights the potential of EGCG as a natural, multi-targeted strategy for NDs but emphasizes the need for further clinical trials to enhance its therapeutic efficacy.",

      "title": "Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pathological tau phosphorylation in traumatic brain injury: implications for chronic traumatic encephalopathy.",
      "abstract": "Tau protein plays a critical role in the physiological functioning of the central nervous system by providing structural integrity to the cytoskeletal architecture of neurons and glia through microtubule assembly and stabilization. Under certain pathological conditions, tau is aberrantly phosphorylated and aggregates into neurotoxic fibrillary tangles. The aggregation and cell-to-cell propagation of pathological tau leads to the progressive deterioration of the nervous system. The clinical entity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) ranges from mild to severe and can promote tau aggregation by inducing cellular mechanisms and signalling pathways that increase tau phosphorylation and aggregation. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is a consequence of repetitive TBI, is a unique tauopathy characterized by pathological tau aggregates located at the depths of the sulci and surrounding blood vessels. The mechanisms leading to increased tau phosphorylation and aggregation in CTE remain to be fully defined but are likely the result of the primary and secondary injury sequelae associated with TBI. The primary injury includes physical and mechanical damage resulting from the head impact and accompanying forces that cause blood-brain barrier disruption and axonal shearing, which primes the central nervous system to be more vulnerable to the subsequent secondary injury mechanisms. A complex interplay of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction activate kinase and cell death pathways, increasing tau phosphorylation, aggregation and neurodegeneration. In this review, we explore the most recent insights into the mechanisms of tau phosphorylation associated with TBI and propose how multiple cellular pathways converge on tau phosphorylation, which may contribute to CTE progression.",

      "abstract": "Lead, a toxic heavy metal, is prevalent in various industrial applications, contributing to environmental contamination and significant health concerns. Lead affects various body systems, especially the brain, causing long-lasting cognitive and behavioral changes. While most studies have focused on continuous lead exposure, intermittent exposure, such as that caused by migration or relocations, has received less attention. Importantly, lead exposure intensifies the severity of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, diseases involving the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in the brain and in the gut. Although the precise mechanisms underlying these observations remain unclear, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction likely play a role. Here, we investigated how two different profiles of lead exposure - continuous and intermittent - affect models of synucleinopathies. We found that lead exposure enhances the formation of aSyn inclusions, resulting in an increase in both their number and size in cell models. In addition, we found that animals injected with aSyn pre-formed fibrils display serine 129-phosphorylated aSyn inclusions and a reduction in astrocytes in the substantia nigra. These animals also display neuronal damage and alterations in locomotor activity, exploration behavior, anxiety, memory impairments and hypertension. Our results suggest a mechanistic link between environmental lead exposure and the onset and progression of diseases associated with aSyn pathology. Understanding the molecular and cellular interactions between lead and aSyn is crucial for shaping public health policies and may provide novel insight into strategies for mitigating the impact of environmental toxins on neurodegenerative processes involved in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies.",

      "abstract": "Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is gaining attention as a key therapeutic target for autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). The primary genetic aetiology of familial PD, accounting for around 5-6\u00a0% of familial cases and 2\u00a0% of sporadic cases, is mutations in the LRRK2 gene. The most prevalent mutation, G2019S, increases kinase activity, which phosphorylates important serine residues that control LRRK2 function, such as Ser910 and Ser935, leading to the development of PD. The development of LRRK2 inhibitors has emerged as a key area of study for PD therapy. In preclinical research, these inhibitors have demonstrated promise in reducing PD-related damage by altering the cellular localisation of LRRK2 and reduced phosphorylation. In addition to kinase action, LRRK2 is involved in autophagy and mitochondrial function. This participation implies that PD markers including mitochondrial dysfunction and defective autophagy may be addressed by LRRK2-targeted treatments. Moreover, selective LRRK2 inhibitors show promise in the treatment of PD, and more research into the molecular role of LRRK2 in PD is essential to developing efficient therapies that will improve patient outcomes and reduce the course of the illness. This review discusses the role of LRRK2 in pathogenesis of PD and current treatment approaches, particularly LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, and their potential to slow disease progression, along with recent advancements in clinical trials and future outlooks for improving outcomes in PD.",

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GRA) belong to a class of compounds that reduce blood glucose and energy intake by simulating actions of endogenous incretin hormone GLP-1 after it is released by the gut following food consumption. They are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity and have systemic effects on various organs, including the brain, liver, pancreas, heart, and the gut. Patients with T2DM have a higher risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD), accompanied by more severe motor deficits and faster disease progression, suggesting dysregulation of insulin signaling in these diseases. Experimental studies have shown that GRA have protective effects to modulate neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial and autophagic functions, and protein misfolding. Hence the compounds have generated enormous interest as novel therapeutic agents against NDs. To date, clinical trials have shown that three GRA, exenatide, liraglutide and lixisenatide can improve motor deficits as an add-on therapy in PD patients and liraglutide can improve cognitive function in AD patients. The neuroprotective effects of these and other GRA, such as PT320 (a sustained-released exenatide) and semaglutide, are still under investigation. The dual GLP-1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists have been demonstrated to have beneficial effects in AD and PD mice models. Overall, GRA are highly promising novel drugs, but future clinical studies should identify which subsets of patients should be targeted as potential candidates for their symptomatic and/or neuroprotective benefits, investigate whether combinations with other classes of drugs can further augment their efficacy, and evaluate their long-term disease-modifying and adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "The motor stage of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be preceded for years by a prodromal stage characterized by non-motor symptoms like REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), hyposmia, and constipation. Here, we show that multiple stages of idiopathic PD, including the pre-motor prodromal stage, can be stratified according to the inflammatory responses to stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ex vivo. IFN\u03b3 stimulation of isolated monocytes reveals increased stimulation-dependent secretion of TNF, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 in prodromal PD relative to moderate stage PD. Additionally, T cells stimulated with CD3/CD28 co-stimulatory beads show diminished proinflammatory cytokine secretion in early-moderate PD relative to prodromal. Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrate that several cytokines produced by stimulated monocytes show high predictive utility for distinguishing prodromal PD individuals from neurologically healthy controls. Moreover, immune stimulation reveals deficits in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell mitochondrial health in moderate PD, with relative mitochondrial health in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells being positively correlated with stimulation-dependent secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-10 in T cells from prodromal PD subjects. Dysregulated mitochondrial health in immune cells may contribute to peripheral inflammation and PD progression, and ex vivo stimulation-based assays have the potential to reveal novel biomarkers for patient stratification and progression with immune endophenotypes.",

      "abstract": "Caspase-3 cleaved tau (truncated tau) is a pathological modification in tau protein that contributes to neurofibrillary tangle formation (NFTs) and neurodegeneration in AD. Our previous studies indicate that truncated tau affects mitochondrial health, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive performance. Therefore, we studied the effects of sulforaphane (SFN), a natural compound activator of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway present in vegetables and sprouts, on neurodegeneration and cognitive decline induced by truncated tau expression in vivo. We induced a 2-month hippocampal expression of GFP, full-length (AAV-Syn-GFP-T4) and truncated tau (AAV-Syn-GFP-T4C3) using a stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated-virus-9 (AAV9) linked to GFP and a synapsin neuronal promoter in tau (-/-) mice. Hippocampal tau-expressing mice were treated with SFN, and their cognitive performance (NOR, NOL, and Barnes maze tests) and hippocampal mitochondrial function were analyzed. Interestingly, hippocampal truncated tau expression significantly affected cognitive and memory abilities, accompanied by increased ROS and severe mitochondrial dysfunction (depolarization, ATP loss, dynamics de-regulation). Notably, the treatment with SFN (50\u00a0mg/kg/day, i.p., two weeks) prevented cognitive impairment and reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics defects induced by hippocampal truncated tau expression. These findings suggest a potential role of SFN in ameliorating cognitive loss and mitochondrial impairment promoted by tau pathology in neurological disorders (NDs).",

The assays involve spectrophotometric and in-gel activity measurements, cytochemical assessment of the mitochondrial transmembrane electrochemical gradient (\u2206\u0470m) to determine if the enzyme acts forward as an ATP synthase or in reverse as an ATPase, and western blot analysis of clear native gels to evaluate Complex V assembly. The whole process can be performed with 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 PBMCs isolated from ~2\u2009ml of blood. Our study suggests that PBMCs can serve as a platform for small-scale, minimally invasive investigations of patients suspected of Complex V deficiency or in biomarker research of mitochondrial function.",

      "abstract": "The disruption of microglial homeostasis and cytokine release are critical for neuroinflammation post-injury and strongly implicated in retinal neurodegenerative diseases like glaucoma. This study examines microglial responses to chemical hypoxia induced by cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>) in BV-2 murine microglial cells, focusing on signaling pathways and proteomic alterations. We assessed the protective effects of monoclonal antibodies against TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. CoCl<sub>2</sub> exposure led to decreased cell viability, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased lactate dehydrogenase release, elevated reactive oxygen species generation, and activation of inflammatory pathways, including nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), STAT1, and NF-\u03baB/NLRP3. These responses were significantly mitigated by treatment with anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IL-1\u03b2, suggesting their dual role in reducing microglial damage and inhibiting inflammatory reactivity. Additionally, these treatments reduced apoptosis by modulating ATF4 and the p38 MAPK/caspase-3 pathways. Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and Gene Ontology revealed that CoCl<sub>2</sub> exposure led to the upregulation of proteins primarily involved in endoplasmic reticulum and catabolic processes, while downregulated proteins are associated with biosynthesis. Anti-TNF\u03b1 and anti-IL-1\u03b2 treatments partially restored the proteomic profile toward normalcy, with network analysis identifying heat shock protein family A member 8 (HSPA8) as a central mediator in recovery. These findings offer insights into the pathogenesis of hypoxic microglial impairment and suggest potential therapeutic targets.",

      "abstract": "Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare, maternally inherited, mitochondrial disease resulting in sudden, progressive central vision loss. The condition affects numerous aspects of daily life, functioning and overall health-related quality of life (HRQL), which may spillover to carers. Two studies were designed to estimate patient utilities associated with varying visual acuity in LHON (study 1) and to explore carer burden (study 2). In study 1, eight LHON health state vignettes (mild vision loss [LogMAR\u2009<\u20090.3] through to light perception [LogMAR\u2009\u2265\u20094]) were valued by the UK and Republic of Ireland (ROI) general pubic using the Health Utilities Index- 3 (HUI-3) and EQ-5D in an online survey (N\u2009=\u2009360) and in time trade-off interviews (TTO; n\u2009=\u2009120). In study 2, nine carers completed in-depth interviews exploring carer burden, the Care-related Quality of Life instrument (CarerQol), EQ-5D-5L and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI). Study 1 demonstrated lower utilities for people with worse visual function. Mild vision loss (LogMAR\u2009<\u20090.3) was rated as 0.84 (HUI-3), 0.79 (EQ-5D) and 0.88 (TTO). Light perception (LogMAR\u2009\u2265\u20094), the most severe health state, was rated as 0.18 (HUI-3), 0.34 (EQ-5D), and 0.36 (TTO). In study 2, qualitative findings revealed substantial burden for many carers and family members. The most prominent impacts were emotional (e.g., guilt, devastation), especially related to the maternal inheritance of LHON. Impacts to carers' daily life, social life and relationships, work, and finances were also described. Standardised measures identified little impact on HRQL (EQ-5D-5L\u2009=\u20090.89), but some carer related burden (CarerQol-7D\u2009=\u200978.4). The WPAI revealed an overall work impairment of 15% and activity impairment of 37%. Findings suggest the HUI-3 may be more sensitive to the HRQL impact of vision loss compared to the EQ-5D and TTO method. The data indicate the potential value of an effective treatment for LHON. Qualitative findings describe the impact of LHON on carers. However, the burden described in the qualitative data was incongruent with quantitative measures, particularly the EQ-5D-5L. This demonstrates the value of conducting mixed-methods research and the importance of selecting measures which capture population-relevant concepts.",

      "title": "Dual targeting of FSP1 and xCT: Potential mechanism of anthocyanins in alleviating neuronal ferroptosis in vascular dementia.",
      "abstract": "VaD, the second most prevalent type of dementia in the elderly following Alzheimer's disease, is marked by significant cognitive and motor deficits, with few effective treatment options currently available. Ferroptosis, a type of regulated cell death driven by iron-mediated lipid peroxidation, has recently emerged as a key pathological mechanism in the development of VaD. Ferroptosis drives neuronal damage in VaD, making it a promising therapeutic target to reduce neuronal death and preserve cognitive function. ACN, a group of polyphenolic compounds recognized for their strong antioxidant properties, have demonstrated potential in reducing ferroptosis and alleviating neuronal damage. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of ACN in reducing ferroptosis and mitigating cognitive impairments associated with VaD, focusing on the dual modulation of the FSP1 and xCT/GPX4 pathways. This novel dual-target approach provides an innovative strategy to reduce neuronal damage and oxidative stress in VaD. A combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments was conducted to assess the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of ACN in mitigating ferroptosis associated with VaD. In vitro, a neurotoxicity model was established by inducing PC12 cells with Glu. Cell viability was determined using the CCK-8 assay, and various markers, including ROS levels, MDA, LPO, and GSH levels, were measured to evaluate the protective effects of ACN. Additionally, the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins, such as FSP1, xCT, and GPX4, was analyzed through Western blotting, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence. In vivo, a VaD rat model was established by performing bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO). The rats were divided into four groups: control, model, ACN-treated (with varying doses), and ALA-treated (positive control). The intervention lasted for 28 days. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Histological analyses, including HE staining and Nissl staining, were carried out to examine neuronal pathology. Moreover, electron microscopy was employed to evaluate mitochondrial ultrastructure integrity. Brain levels of iron, lipid peroxidation markers, and the expression of FSP1, xCT, and GPX4 were measured to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects. Systematic in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the significant neuroprotective effects of ACN against ferroptosis associated with VaD. In the Glu-induced PC12 cell model, ACN significantly improved cell viability, reduced ROS levels, restored GSH levels, and decreased the accumulation of MDA and LPO. Notably, ACN upregulated the expression of key ferroptosis-suppressing proteins, FSP1, xCT, and GPX4, through dual activation of these pathways, highlighting its powerful protective role against oxidative stress and ferroptosis. In the 2-VO VaD rat model, high-dose ACN significantly improved cognitive function, as shown by reduced escape latency in the Morris water maze and increased platform crossings. Moreover, ACN treatment enhanced the discrimination index in the novel object recognition test, suggesting improved learning and memory. Histopathological analyses revealed that ACN significantly alleviated neuronal disorganization, increased Nissl body counts, and restored mitochondrial integrity, with reduced swelling, rupture, and vacuolation observed under electron microscopy. ACN exerts significant neuroprotective effects in VaD by dual regulation of the FSP1 and xCT/GPX4 pathways, effectively inhibiting ferroptosis and alleviating oxidative stress. This \"dual-target\" mechanism not only expands the current understanding of ACN's neuroprotective effects but also emphasizes its unique role in inhibiting ferroptosis. Overall, this study provides experimental evidence supporting the potential use of ACN in treating ferroptosis-related neurodegenerative diseases and highlights its promising prospects for clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Nonsyndromic and syndromic hereditary optic neuropathies (HONs) encompass a variety of genetic illnesses that cause progressive optic nerve damage, resulting in considerable vision impairment. These disorders result from pathogenic variants in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA, impacting essential cellular processes like oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dynamics, and neuroprotection. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have significantly improved the identification of genetic variations, enabling precise diagnoses and genotype-phenotype correlations. This review consolidates current knowledge regarding the classification, molecular pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methodologies, and emerging therapeutic strategies for HONs. The critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in optic nerve degeneration highlights the necessity for multimodal therapeutic approaches. Recent clinical trials evaluating gene therapy for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and neuroprotective strategies in dominant optic atrophy (DOA) are discussed. Additionally, individualized therapeutic interventions, as demonstrated by recent case studies involving tailored gene therapies, are evaluated. The integration of molecular and imaging biomarkers in future personalized treatment strategies aims to enhance prognosis and therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin A (retinol) and its derivatives (retinoids) assume critical roles in neural development, cellular differentiation, axon elongation, programmed cell apoptosis and various fundamental cellular processes. Retinoids function by binding to specific nuclear receptors, such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), activating specific signalling pathways in the cells. The disruption of the retinoic acid signalling pathway can result in neuroinflammation, oxidative and ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and has been implicated in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. The present study explored the potential therapeutic application of our innovative CNS-permeable synthetic retinoid, Ellorarxine, for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in vitro. An MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) tetrazolium assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence staining were performed. Ellorarxine increased Cyp26 and, selectively, RAR\u03b2 protein expression in neurons, glia and microglia. Ellorarxine significantly reduced cell death (neurons, glia), increased mitochondrial viability (neurons), modulated cytokine release (microglia), and positively regulated cellular autophagy (neurons, glia, microglia). These results suggest that Ellorarxine is a promising drug candidate that should be further investigated in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Oxidative Stress in People Living With HIV: Are Diverse Supplement Sources the Solution?",
      "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS to a manageable chronic condition even though no cure exists. Despite ART control, latent HIV infection results in failed memory CD4 T-cell responses, immune overactivation, inflammation, oxidative stress, genomic instability, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, and premature CD4 T-cell ageing. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species during oxidative stress can cause mitochondrial DNA damage, cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, and premature aging in people living with HIV (PLWH). This review outlines current knowledge in oxidative stress among PLWH. Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Science Direct were searched for literature conforming with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines from studies published from January 2013 to December 2023. A total of 75 studies from 22 countries were identified, with 52 studies carried out in human participants, 17 studies in cell lines, and 6 studies in animal models to assess oxidative stress levels. An increased oxidative stress with no changes in antioxidant levels was reported in HIV-positive smokers, and those on substance abuse. Long-term ART usage showed high levels of oxidative protein products and low levels of antioxidants when compared to short-term ART usage. The use of supplements such as N-acetylcysteine, selenium, and silibinin in animal models and cell lines showed increased cell viability, reduced reactive oxygen species, and increased antioxidant levels, which are promising therapeutic interventions that should be studied in PLWH to further help improve their disease outcomes. Identifying extracts from natural and synthetic products with antioxidant effects will improve the general well-being of PLWH.",

From a genetic perspective, animal models using gene-editing technologies offer distinct advantages in replicating the pathophysiological traits of PD, while also functionally exploring potential treatment targets. In this review, we highlight the available gene- modified animal models related to various mechanisms of PD, including abnormal expression of alpha-synuclein protein, dysfunction of the autophagy-lysosome system, abnormalities in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and mitochondrial dysfunction. We further discuss their respective strengths, limitations, and prospects, aiming to provide the most up to date information for the application of PD animal models and the advancement of anti-PD drugs.",

      "abstract": "Protein methylesterase-1 (PME-1) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the demethylation of protein phosphatases 2A (PP2A) and PP4 catalytic subunits to alter the composition of holoenzymes. Elevated PME-1 protein levels are observed in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, suggesting the involvement of dysregulation of PP2A/PP4 methylation. However, PME-1 also forms stable complexes with the catalytic subunit of PP2A to interfere with phosphatase activity, and it remains unclear what roles the functions as a methylesterase and as a PP2A inhibitory protein each play in\u00a0vivo. This study generated PME-1 S156A and M335D knock-in mice deficient in methylesterase and PP2A inhibitory activity, respectively. Each loss of function mutation compromised development in\u00a0vivo differently, with phenotypes distinct from the perinatal lethality of PME-1 null mice. The loss of methylesterase activity due to the S156A mutation resulted in systemic apoptosis characterized by brain atrophy: the layers of the cerebellum collapsed with fewer Purkinje cells and more microglia. Histological and gene expression analyses indicated increased inflammation and apoptosis. Primary embryonic fibroblasts isolated from S156A KI mice exhibited increased mitochondrial number, enhanced oxygen consumption rate, and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, M335D mutant pups did not appear deformed and had intact brains but died about two days after birth with a demonstrated loss of olfaction and apoptosis in the olfactory epithelium. Our data indicate that the action of PP2A-type phosphatases is controlled in multiple ways by PME-1 and differentially contributes to mouse development.",

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation, microglial activation, and oxidative stress contribute to neuropsychiatric deficits following spinal cord injury (SCI). Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of HBO on depressive-like behavior, cognitive impairment, and hippocampal pathology in a rat model of SCI. We employed a battery of behavioral assessments, unbiased stereological analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and biochemical assays to evaluate neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and iron accumulation in the hippocampus. Untargeted proteomic analysis was conducted to identify potential molecular targets of HBO. Western blotting was used to assess the activation of the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway. ML385, a selective Nrf2 inhibitor, was intrathecally administered 30\u2009min prior to daily HBO treatment to validate pathway involvement. HBO treatment significantly alleviated depressive-like behavior and cognitive deficits in SCI rats. It also suppressed M1-type microglial activation and reduced hippocampal neuroinflammation. Additionally, HBO mitigated neuronal ferroptosis induced by SCI through activation of the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway. The protective effects of HBO were abolished by coadministration of ML385, confirming the critical role of Nrf2 signaling in mediating its anti-ferroptosis effects. These findings highlight ferroptosis as a key pathological mechanism in SCI-induced hippocampal damage and suggest that HBO therapy alleviates depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment by targeting the Nrf2/GPX4 pathway. This study provides new insights into the therapeutic potential of HBO in managing SCI-related neuropsychiatric dysfunction.",

Therefore, the search for effective intervention measures has become the top priority to deal with this difficult burden. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used for the past 50 years to treat conditions such as decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning and radiation damage. In recent years, studies have confirmed that HBOT has good effects in improving cognitive impairment after brain injury and stroke, and alleviating neurodegeneration and dysfunction related to NDD. Here we reviewed the pathogenesis and treatment state of NDD, introduced the application of HBOT in animal models and clinical studies of NDD, and expounded the application potential of HBOT in the treatment of NDD from the perspective of mitochondrial function, neuroinflammation, neurogenesis and angiogenesis, oxidative stress, apoptosis, microcirculation and epigenetics.",

Mitochondria, the main site of cellular energy metabolism, are essential for maintaining cell growth and function. Their function is regulated by various transcription factors and coactivators. PGC-1\u03b1 regulates the biogenesis, dynamics, energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and autophagy processes of mitochondria by interacting with multiple nuclear transcription factors, thereby exerting significant effects on mitochondrial function. This review explores the biological functions of PGC-1\u03b1 and its regulatory effects and related mechanisms on mitochondria, providing important information for our in-depth understanding of the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in cellular metabolism. The potential role of PGC-1\u03b1 in metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases was also discussed, providing a theoretical basis for the development of new treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration and necrosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and decreased dopamine secretion in the striatum. Bile acids are important components of animal bile. In recent years, a variety of hydrophilic bile acids have been reported to have ameliorative effects in neurodegenerative diseases. Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) is one of the components of bile acids. However, whether TCDCA can treat PD and its specific mechanism is unclear. In this study, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model mice were established to investigate the effects of TCDCA on PD model mice and the impact of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Concurrently, in vitro cell experiments utilized the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 microglial inflammation model to further investigate the effect and mechanism of TCDCA in inhibiting neuroinflammation. TCDCA effectively improved dyskinesia, attenuated dopaminergic neuronal damage in the substantia nigra and striatum, and inhibited \u03b1-Synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) expression in the substantia nigra of PD mice. TCDCA significantly inhibited microglia and astrocyte activation in the substantia nigra of PD mice, and decreased the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expressions of inflammatory factors. In addition, TCDCA was found to inhibit nitric oxide release and reactive oxygen species production in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. Furthermore, TCDCA suppressed the production of inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), both in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, TCDCA significantly promoted Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) protein expression and inhibited the phosphorylation of serine/threonine kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) and inhibitor of NF\u03baB (I\u03baB\u03b1). TCDCA promoted autophagy in vivo and in vitro by increasing adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation, increasing LC3II/LC3I and Beclin1 expression, and decreasing P62 expression. Furthermore, TCDCA demonstrated mitochondrial protection by enhancing the expression of PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1) and Parkin. However, knockdown of TGR5 expression partially counteracted the inhibitory effect of TCDCA on LPS-treated BV-2\u00a0cells. Our results manifested that TCDCA activated autophagy and inhibited microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in experimental PD models probably through regulation of AKT/NF\u03baB, AMPK/mTOR and Pink1/Parkin signaling pathways via activation of TGR5.",

      "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that the mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact site is a novel microdomain essential for cellular homeostasis. Various proteins are accumulated at the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), an ER subcomponent closely associated with the mitochondria, contributing to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer to the mitochondria, lipid synthesis, mitochondrial fission/fusion, and autophagy. These functions are disrupted in the diseases, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we summarize the disruption of protein homeostasis in various neurodegenerative diseases, present recent works on the mechanisms of MAM aberration, including ours mainly focused on ALS, and then discuss challenges and prospects for future MAM-targeted therapies in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "The Power Struggle: Kynurenine Pathway Enzyme Knockouts and Brain Mitochondrial Respiration.",
      "abstract": "Numerous illnesses, including neurological and mental disorders, have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Disruptions in mitochondrial respiration and energy production have been linked to dysmetabolism of the tryptophan (Trp)-kynurenine (KYN) pathway, which produces a diverse array of bioactive metabolites. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a putative neuroprotectant. The exact mechanisms through which Trp-KYN metabolic dysregulation affects mitochondrial function remain largely unclear. This study investigates the impact of the genetic deletion of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) enzymes, which are responsible for KYNA synthesis, on mitochondrial function, specifically mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, and its potential role in neuropsychiatric pathology. CRISPR/Cas9-induced knockout mouse strains kat1<sup>-/-</sup>, kat2<sup>-/-</sup>, and kat3<sup>-/-</sup> were generated. Eight-to-ten-week-old male mice were used, and cerebral and hepatic respiration, complex I- and II-linked oxidative phosphorylation (CI and CII OXPHOS), and complex IV (CIV) activity were measured using high-resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential changes were measured with Fluorescence-Sensor Blue and safranin dye. KAT knockout mice exhibited significantly lower cerebellar respiration (CI OXPHOS, CII OXPHOS, and CIV activity) compared to wild-type mice. Lower baseline respiration and attenuated OXPHOS activities were observed in the hippocampus and striatum, particularly in kat2<sup>-/-</sup> and kat3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Non-neuronal tissues showed reduced CIV activity, while ADP-stimulated CI and CII OXPHOS remained unchanged. The deletion of the KAT genes significantly impairs mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, potentially contributing to pathogenesis. This study highlights the importance of KYNA in mitochondrial function, offering new insights into potential therapeutic targets for various disorders. Targeting the KYN pathway could mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction in a variety of diseased conditions.",

      "title": "Role of mGluR7 in Alzheimer's disease: pathophysiological insights and therapeutic approaches.",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterised by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic impairment, and neuronal loss. The progression of AD depends on two main pathologic features, amyloid-beta accumulation, and tau pathology, whereas the disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission plays an essential role in disease progression. Glutamate, the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter, acts on ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7) is a pre-synaptic type III mGluR receptor playing a crucial role in the central nervous\u00a0system (CNS)\u00a0through\u00a0neurotransmitter modulation, reducing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and promoting early neuronal growth. Since\u00a0mGluR7 is a key regulator of neurotransmitter release, it\u00a0modulates synaptic integrity and neuronal survival, and its dysfunction is associated with impaired synaptic homeostasis in AD. Moreover, mGluR7 interacts with neuroinflammatory pathways by activating microglia and regulating cytokine production, therefore playing a significant role in AD pathogenesis. The drugs targeting mGluR7, including\u00a0mGluR7 agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators, could potentially be among the most effective\u00a0agents for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative diseases including AD, as well as neurodevelopmental impairments, though these potential therapies remain in the early stages. This article summarises the\u00a0structure as well as the function of mGluR7 and explores\u00a0current insights into the functioning of mGluR7 in molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis. It also discusses\u00a0potential therapeutic targets of mGluR7, highlighting the need to develop such therapies to prevent disease progression.",

      "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), the disturbance of energy metabolism due to glucose metabolic reprogramming may be a critical factor contributing to neuronal degeneration and death. Glycolysis, as the core process of glucose metabolism, not only serves as a fundamental source of energy but also integrates various metabolic pathways. However, the precise role of alterations in glycolysis-related pathways in the progression of PD remains elusive. We compared and analysed datasets from human databases of patients with PD and healthy controls to identify differentially expressed genes associated with glycolysis. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method and multivariate logistic regression analysis, we identified glucan-branching enzyme 1 (GBE1) as the most confident glycolytic gene implicated in PD. We validated the low expression of GBE1 in 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD animal models. Stereotaxic injection-mediated overexpression of GBE1 in striatal neurons improved motor dysfunction in these animal models. In vitro experiments demonstrated that GBE1 promotes the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), enhances cellular glycolytic flux, and thereby increases the viability of PC12 cells under MPP<sup>+</sup> treatment. Additionally, GBE1 alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction and restores oxidative phosphorylation in PD. In summary, by integrating machine learning and bioinformatics approaches, we identified GBE1, a glycolysis-related gene with significant implications for PD, elucidating its crucial role in glucose metabolic reprogramming and identifying potential therapeutic targets for modulating glucose metabolism in PD.",

      "abstract": "Alpha-synucleinopathies, characterized by extracellular alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn or SNCA) accumulation and aggregation, have been linked to neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. P2RX7 is a non-selective cationic transmembrane purinergic receptor activated by elevated levels of extracellular ATP, which typically occurs during inflammatory conditions. Activation of P2RX7 by \u03b1Syn is implicated in neuronal degeneration, potentially causing pore dilation and increased inflammation. By integrating the data curation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, along with structural analyses, we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and binding sites for P2RX7-\u03b1Syn interaction. We elucidated interactions between P2RX7 and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of \u03b1Syn. Utilizing cryo-EM structures of P2RX7 in ATP-bound and unbound states, we assessed \u03b1Syn's effect on P2RX7 structural and functional dynamics. Initially, the analyses revealed that \u03b1Syn interactomes are mainly involved in mitochondrial functions, while P2RX7 interactors are linked to receptor internalization and calcium transport. Molecular docking with six tools identified that \u03b1Syn-NTD fragments preferentially bind to the proximal region of P2RX7's transmembrane domain. Microsecond all atom MD simulations in a POPS lipid bilayer showed significant atomic fluctuations, particularly in the head region, lower body, and large loop of P2RX7's cytoplasmic domain. Secondary structure analysis indicated unfolding in regions related to pore dilation and receptor desensitization. Further by contact-based and solvent accessibility analyses, along with protein structure network (PSN) studies, we identified crucial residues involved in \u03b1Syn-P2RX7 interactions. This understanding enhances the knowledge of how \u03b1Syn and P2RX7 interactions take place, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative diseases, and could be instrumental in developing future preventive and therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is closely associated with the pathological manifestations of multiple neurodegenerative diseases via the gut-brain axis, which refers to the crosstalk between the gut and the central nervous system. More importantly, mitochondria have been considered prominent mediators of the interplay between the gut microbiota and the brain. Intestinal microbes may modulate mitochondrial function in the central nervous system to affect the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria are essential for meeting the host's substantial neuronal metabolic demands, maintaining excitability, and facilitating synaptic transmission. Dysfunctional mitochondria are considered critical hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this review provides novel insights into the intricate roles of gut microbiota-mitochondrial crosstalk in the underlying mechanisms during the progression of neurodegeneration, as well as the existing potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders. These suggest intestinal microbiota-mitochondrial interaction play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases, and targeting this interaction may be a promising therapeutic approach to neurodegenerative diseases. However, this review found that there was relatively little research on the effect of this crosstalk on other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease and Multiple sclerosis, and the potential therapeutic strategies were translated into clinical trials, which face many challenges in developing personalized treatment plans based on the unique gut microbiota of different individuals.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial stress disassembles nuclear architecture through proteolytic activation of PKC\u03b4 and Lamin B1 phosphorylation in neuronal cells: implications for pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",
      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are central to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. Neurons, particularly dopaminergic (DAergic) ones, are highly vulnerable to mitochondrial stress; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this vulnerability remain poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that protein kinase C delta (PKC\u03b4) is highly expressed in DAergic neurons and mediates apoptotic cell death during neurotoxic stress via caspase-3-mediated proteolytic activation. Herein, we further uncovered a key downstream molecular event of PKC\u03b4 signaling following mitochondrial dysfunction that governs neuronal cell death by dissembling nuclear architecture. Exposing N27 DAergic cells to the mitochondrial complex-1 inhibitor tebufenpyrad (Tebu) induced PKC\u03b4 phosphorylation at the T505 activation loop accompanied by caspase-3-dependent proteolytic activation. High-resolution 3D confocal microscopy revealed that proteolytically activated cleaved PKC\u03b4 translocates to the nucleus, colocalizing with Lamin B1. Electron microscopy also visualized nuclear membrane damage in Tebu-treated N27 cells. <i>In silico</i> analyses identified threonine site on Lamin B1 (T575) as a phosphorylation site of PKC\u03b4. Interestingly, N27 DAergic cells stably expressing a PKC\u03b4 cleavage-resistant mutant failed to induce nuclear damage, PKC\u03b4 activation, and Lamin B1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-based stable knockdown of PKC\u03b4 greatly attenuated Tebu-induced Lamin B1 phosphorylation. Also, studies using the Lamin B1<sup>T575G</sup> phosphorylation mutant and PKC\u03b4-\u0394NLS-overexpressing N27 cells showed that PKC\u03b4 activation and translocation to the nuclear membrane are essential for phosphorylating Lamin B1 at T575 to induce nuclear membrane damage during Tebu insult. Additionally, Tebu failed to induce Lamin B1 damage and Lamin B1 phosphorylation in organotypic midbrain slices cultured from PKC\u03b4<sup>-/-</sup> mouse pups. Postmortem analyses of PD brains revealed significantly higher PKC\u03b4 activation, Lamin B1 phosphorylation, and Lamin B1 loss in nigral DAergic neurons compared to age-matched healthy controls, demonstrating the translational relevance of these findings. Collectively, our data reveal that PKC\u03b4 functions as a Lamin B1 kinase to disassemble the nuclear membrane during mitochondrial stress-induced neuronal death. This mechanistic insight may have important implications for the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction as well as for the development of novel treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial transplantation (MT), an innovative regenerative technique widely used to treat diseases caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, shows great promise for clinical application. This procedure can increase the number of mitochondria and improve the function of damaged mitochondria, resulting in increased adenosine triphosphate levels, decreased reactive oxygen species production, improved Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering capacity, modulated inflammatory response, and reduced apoptosis to protect cells, thus promoting tissue repair. In this review, we describe research advances in MT over the last five years, focusing on its application in treating various diseases, including ischaemic injuries (of the kidney, heart, lung, and liver), neurodegenerative disorders, spinal cord injury, sepsis, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and ultraviolet radiation injuries, as well as in procedures such as organ transplantation, focusing on instances where MT demonstrated good efficacy. We also cover the application of engineered mitochondria and mitochondrial combination therapies and present the latest advances in improving MT efficiency, as well as the current clinical applications and shortcomings of MT, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation for enhanced MT utilisation in the future.",

      "abstract": "The cure rate for chronic neurodegenerative diseases remains low, creating an urgent need for improved intervention methods. Recent studies have shown that enhancing mitochondrial function can mitigate the effects of these diseases. This paper comprehensively reviews the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to uncover the potential use of targeted mitochondrial interventions as viable therapeutic options. We detail five targeted mitochondrial intervention strategies for chronic neurodegenerative diseases that act by promoting mitophagy, inhibiting mitochondrial fission, enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, applying mitochondria-targeting antioxidants, and transplanting mitochondria. Each method has unique advantages and potential limitations, making them suitable for various therapeutic situations. Therapies that promote mitophagy or inhibit mitochondrial fission could be particularly effective in slowing disease progression, especially in the early stages. In contrast, those that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and apply mitochondria-targeting antioxidants may offer great benefits during the middle stages of the disease by improving cellular antioxidant capacity and energy metabolism. Mitochondrial transplantation, while still experimental, holds great promise for restoring the function of damaged cells. Future research should focus on exploring the mechanisms and effects of these intervention strategies, particularly regarding their safety and efficacy in clinical settings. Additionally, the development of innovative mitochondria-targeting approaches, such as gene editing and nanotechnology, may provide new solutions for treating chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Implementing combined therapeutic strategies that integrate multiple intervention methods could also enhance treatment outcomes.",

      "title": "Systematic review of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in aging: A focus on neuromuscular junctions.",
      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are widely regarded as primary drivers of aging and are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. The degeneration of motor neurons during aging is a critical pathological factor contributing to the progression of sarcopenia. However, the morphological and functional changes in mitochondria and their interplay in the degeneration of the neuromuscular junction during aging remain poorly understood. A defined systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases (last accessed on October 30, 2024) was conducted with search terms including 'mitochondria', 'aging' and 'NMJ'. Clinical and preclinical studies of mitochondrial dysfunction and neuromuscular junction degeneration during aging. Twentyseven studies were included in this systematic review. This systematic review provides a summary of morphological, functional and biological changes in neuromuscular junction, mitochondrial morphology, biosynthesis, respiratory chain function, and mitophagy during aging. We focus on the interactions and mechanisms underlying the relationship between mitochondria and neuromuscular junctions during aging. Aging is characterized by significant reductions in mitochondrial fusion/fission cycles, biosynthesis, and mitochondrial quality control, which may lead to neuromuscular junction dysfunction, denervation and poor physical performance. Motor nerve terminals that exhibit redox sensitivity are among the first to exhibit abnormalities, ultimately leading to an early decline in muscle strength through impaired neuromuscular junction transmission function. Parg coactivator 1 alpha is a crucial molecule that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and modulates various pathways, including the mitochondrial respiratory chain, energy deficiency, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is correlated with neuromuscular junction denervation and acetylcholine receptor fragmentation, resulting in muscle atrophy and a decrease in strength during aging. Physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, and gene therapy can alleviate the structural degeneration and functional deterioration of neuromuscular junction by restoring mitochondrial function. Therefore, mitochondria are considered potential targets for preserving neuromuscular junction morphology and function during aging to treat sarcopenia.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognitive function. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in its pathological process. The mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn2 plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular health. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular structure of mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn2 and its role in Alzheimer's disease, combined with the effects of exercise assisted regulation, to evaluate its potential in alleviating symptoms. By constructing a brain model of Alzheimer's disease, conducting pathological analysis and molecular dynamics simulations, we aim to explore the relationship between the disease and mitochondrial function. Analyze the molecular structure of Mfn2, study its role in normal and pathological states, and evaluate its impact on Mfn2 and mitochondrial function through exercise intervention. The study demonstrated the typical pathological features of Alzheimer's disease and confirmed the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and disease progression. The structural analysis of mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn2 indicates its importance in promoting mitochondrial fusion. Exercise intervention significantly increased the expression of Mfn2 and improved mitochondrial function, further alleviating pathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria plays a key role in the physiological function of neurons, and alteration of this organelle results in severe and irreversible cell damage. Altered mitochondrial activity usually leads to cell degeneration that compromises the function of the neuronal network. Oxidative stress represents the main critical point of this mitochondrial alteration. Research focuses on finding specific treatments for the mitochondrion to target molecules capable of acting in that specific organelle. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated a series of mitochondria-targeted compounds derived from natural phenolic acids, including caffeic, syringic, gallic and rosmarinic acid, intending to enhance their antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Among these, MITO-rosmarinic was a highly effective compound, demonstrating the ability to mitigate oxidative stress-induced damage in neuronal cells. Our findings underscore the potential of MITO-rosmarinic as a candidate for preventing mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Stroke continues to be a major adverse event in advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) patients after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation. Abnormalities in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) have been critically implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral ischemia. We hypothesize that prior stroke may be associated with systemic mitochondrial OxPhos abnormalities, and impaired more in post-CF-LVAD patients with risk of developing new stroke. We studied 50 CF-LVAD patients (25 with prior stroke, 25 without); OxPhos complex proteins (complex I [C.I]-complex V [C.V]) were measured in blood leukocytes. Both at baseline (pre-CF-LVAD) and postoperatively (post-CF-LVAD), the prior-stroke group had significantly lower C.I, complex II (C.II), complex IV (C.IV), and C.V proteins when compared to the no-prior-stroke group. Oxidative phosphorylation proteins were significantly decreased in prior-stroke group at post-CF-LVAD compared to pre-CF-LVAD. Machine learning Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Random Forest modeling identified six prognostic factors that predicted postoperative stroke with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.93. Oxidative phosphorylation protein reduction appeared to be associated with the new stroke after implantation. Our study found for the first time the existence of mitochondrial dysfunction at the peripheral level in CHF patients with prior ischemic stroke even before CF-LVAD implantation. The changes in OxPhos protein expression could serve as biomarkers in predicting new post-CF-LVAD strokes.",

      "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron loss, leading to severe physical impairment and mortality. Despite available treatments like Riluzole and Edaravone, their limited efficacy highlights the need for improved understanding of ALS pathology. This study has explored metabolic alterations in North Indian ALS patients using <sup>1</sup>H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics. A case-control study, involving 45 ALS patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) was performed. Serum samples were analyzed using 600-MHz NMR spectrometer, revealing significant metabolic differences between ALS and HC groups. Multivariate analyses identified nine dysregulated metabolites-pyruvate, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, imidazole, arginine, creatinine, and choline-with ROC analysis showing isoleucine as a promising biomarker (AUC 83%). Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted disruptions in key metabolic pathways, including the Glucose-Alanine Cycle, Urea Cycle, Ammonia Recycling, and the Warburg Effect, suggesting potential links to neuroinflammatory and mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS pathogenesis. This pilot study provides insight into ALS-specific metabolic alterations in Indian cohort and demonstrates the potential of these metabolites as diagnostic biomarkers. Our findings identify potential biomarkers that require validation in larger, multi-centric cohorts to support diagnosis, prognosis, and improved management of ALS.",

LRRK2 plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial function and cellular senescence by regulating key processes such as autophagy, oxidative stress, and protein aggregation. LRRK2 is also associated with ciliogenesis in regulating neuronal development. In addition, LRRK2 has been implicated as a putative mediator in neuroinflammation via promoting the reactivation of microglia and influencing cytokine production, a factor that may have therapeutic implications. Furthermore, mutations in LRRK2 have been found to impact the production of neurotrophic factors in astrocytes, the star-shaped glial cells of the central nervous system, thereby affecting neuronal health and contributing to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases like PD. The multifaceted roles of LRRK2 in cellular senescence, interaction with LRS, neuroinflammation, the maintenance of mitochondria, and astrocyte function highlight its significance as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "Redox homeostasis is impaired in Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA), a neurodegenerative disease caused by the decreased expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Nrf2, the master regulator of tissue redox balance, is defective in the disease, driving cells to ferroptosis. Neuro-inflammation is recently emerging as an additional pathological mechanism in FRDA and has to be understood in order to go deeper into the pathogenesis of the disease. As a functional cross talk between Nrf2 and NF-kB pathways has been previously reported, we wonder if inflammation may be activated in FRDA as a consequence of Nrf2 deficiency. Thus, we analyzed the expression of proteins involved in the antioxidant and inflammatory responses in fibroblasts of patients with FRDA. We found a significant activation of the TLR4/NF-kB/IL-1\u03b2 axis in patients, associated to a consistent increase of the redox enzymes thioredoxin 1 (TRX1) and glutaredoxin 1 (GLRX1), which are essential to activate NF-kB under oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, we investigated the role of 4-HNE, a by-product of lipid peroxidation, as a potential mediator between ferroptosis and inflammation in FRDA.",

      "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease with both clinical and hereditary heterogeneity. Inflammation has been suggested to play an important role in ALS pathophysiology. In this study, we aimed to identify serum inflammatory alterations and develop effective inflammatory biomarkers to assist in the diagnosis of ALS. Through proximity extension assay (PEA), we investigated serum inflammatory alterations in two ALS cohorts compared with healthy controls (HCs), including sporadic ALS patients and genetic ALS patients. We found that CHIT1, OSM, SIRT2, CDCP1 and 5 other factors were significantly increased in sporadic ALS patients in both cohorts and that SIRT2, CDCP1 and 6 other factors were different between genetic ALS patients and HCs. Using XGBoost and binary logistic regression analysis, we developed a two-serum protein diagnostic panel (CHIT1 and CDCP1), and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.904 in the original cohort and 0.907 in the replication cohort. Based on Mendelian Randomization (MR), OSM and SIRT2 are significantly associated with the risk of ALS. In conclusion, our study revealed a consistent and replicable serum inflammatory profile and developed a biomarker panel that can differentiate ALS patients from HCs in two cohorts, which may play an important role in advancing our current understanding of the inflammatory process and identifying novel therapeutic strategies for ALS patients.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy are closely linked with human diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been shown to mediate a wide range of pathological responses by binding with the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and toll-like receptors (TLRs). Extracellular HMGB1 and its ligand RAGE stimulate the growth, metastasis, invasiveness, and treatment resistance of different cancer cells. Through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling, HMGB1 and RAGE lead to the phosphorylation of Drp1-S616 and Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission, which consequently causes autophagy. Although the structure of the RAGE and HMGB1 complex is not clearly known, the complex has emerged as a potential therapeutic target. In the present study, the structure of the RAGE and HMGB1 complex was determined at a resolution of 5.19\u202f\u00c5 using cryogenic electron microscopy. The structure revealed that the residues P66, G70, P71, S74, and R77 in RAGE and E145, K146, E153, and E156 in HMGB1 were the sites of interaction between the two proteins. Additionally, an HMGB1 peptide (151 LKEKYEK 157) was synthesized based on the RAGE-HMGB1 complex. We investigated the inhibitory function of the HMGB1 peptide and demonstrated that it inhibits tumor growth, metastasis, and invasion by binding to the RAGE protein in lung cancers. The HMGB1 peptide significantly suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction and the initiation of autophagy. Furthermore, the HMGB1 peptide dramatically reduced cell viability, migration, and mitophagy in the colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell lines HCT-116 and AsPC-1, respectively.",

Herein, we develop a scalable polymer-involved biomimetic assembly that responds to intracerebral reactive oxygen species (ROS) for elastic spreading and concentration-dependent drug therapy. Structurally, a polymer of thermally sensitive deformation is selected for hydrophobic loading of curcumin (Cur) and coordinative grafting onto ultrasmall ceria (CeO<sub>2</sub>) by elastic compression at transition temperature, which is further sealed by self-polymerized dopamine with apolipoprotein decoration to improve intracerebral shuttling. When triggered by ROS in the lesions, burst exposure of Cur and polymer-linked CeO<sub>2</sub> (PCeO<sub>2</sub>) is achieved. The concentrated Cur switches amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-activated microglia into normal for mobilizing phagocytosis, and CeO<sub>2</sub> has sustainable antioxidant capacity to prevent microglial mitochondrial damage after phagocytosis of PCeO<sub>2</sub>-captured A\u03b2. After administration, our findings reveal microglia-mediated A\u03b2 clearance, neuroprotection, and ROS elimination in AD mice. Collectively, this biomimetic assembly provides a promising approach in AD treatments.",

      "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that has multiple factors that make its molecular pathogenesis difficult to understand and its diagnosis and treatment during the early stages difficult to determine. Discovering novel biomarkers in ALS for diagnostic and therapeutic potential has become important. Consequently, bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms are useful for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and potential biomarkers, as well as understanding the molecular mechanisms and intricacies of diseases such as ALS. To achieve the aim of the present study, six datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were utilized and analyzed using an integrative bioinformatics and machine learning approach. Log transformation was done during data preprocessing, RMA normalization was performed, and the batch effect was corrected. Differential expression analysis identified 206 DEGs that were significantly associated with different\u00a0biological processes, including muscle function, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial membrane activity. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted pathways, including those related to prion disease, Parkinson's disease, and ATP synthesis via chemiosmotic coupling. We employed a multi-step machine learning framework incorporating random forest, LASSO regression, and SVM-RFE to identify robust biomarkers. This approach identified three key genes, CHRNA1, DLG5, and PLA2G4C, which could be explored as promising biomarkers for ALS after further validation. The internal validation, including\u00a0principal component analysis (PCA) and ROC-AUC analysis, demonstrated strong diagnostic potential of these hub genes, achieving an AUC of 0.96. This work highlights the utility of bioinformatics and machine learning in identifying key genes as biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic potential in ALS.",

      "abstract": "<b>Rationale:</b> One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) may be a risk factor for the neuropathology linked to amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation. However, the mechanisms underlying HSV1-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in AD remain unclear. ALT001 is a novel drug that ameliorates AD-related cognitive impairment via ULK1/Rab9-mediated alternative mitophagy. In this study, we investigated the effects of ALT001 on the neurodegeneration-related microglial signatures associated with HSV1 infection. <b>Methods:</b> Molecular mechanisms and physiological functions of mitophagy was investigated in HSV1-infected microglia, including primary murine and human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived microglia (ES-MG), as well as in a microglia-neuron co-culture system. Microglial gene signatures following HSV1 infection in the presence or absence of ALT001 were analyzed using bulk RNA sequencing, and the effects of ALT001 on microglial phagocytosis and microglia-mediated immune responses were further evaluated by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles. <b>Results:</b> HSV1 infection inhibited PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy via HSV1-encoded protein kinase US3, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction in both human and mouse microglia. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of HSV1-infected microglia revealed an upregulation of distinct microglial genes associated with disease-associated microglia (DAM)-like phenotype and pro-inflammatory activity. Pharmacological targeting of mitophagy using ALT001 prevents mitochondrial damage caused by HSV1 through ULK1/Rab9-mediated pathway. Furthermore, ALT001-induced ULK1/Rab9-dependent mitophagy restricts HSV1 infection by activating interferon-mediated antiviral immunity. Consequently, ALT001 reduces HSV1-triggered neuroinflammation, recovers HSV1-altered microglial phagocytosis for A\u03b2, and efficiently reverses morphological and molecular abnormalities in HSV1-infected microglia by triggering mitophagy in ES-MG. ALT001 also suppressed HSV1-mediated A\u03b2 accumulation and neurodegeneration in the microglia-neuron co-culture and cerebral organoid model. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this study, we identified a critical molecular link between HSV1 and AD-related microglial dysfunction. Furthermore, our findings provide an evidence that therapeutic targeting of alternative mitophagy via ALT001 effectively interfere with HSV1-induced microglial dysfunction and alleviate neurodegeneration.",

      "abstract": "Epalrestat (EPS), an aldose reductase inhibitor, is used to alleviate peripheral nerve disorder of diabetic patients in clinical therapy. Even though EPS exerted effects in central nervous system diseases, the neuroprotection and underlying molecular mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease (PD), remains obscure. Our study aimed to investigate the potential of EPS suppressed PD progression both in vivo and in vitro. We used 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridillium ion (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-treated PD cells and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated PD mice to investigate the protective function and molecular mechanism of EPS in PD. EPS was administered three times daily through oral route 3\u00a0days before model establishment for 5 consecutive days. Behavioral manifestation of mice was conducted using open field test, rotarod test and CatWalk gait analysis. Immunofluorescence was used to detect dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons survival in the substantia nigra. Subsequently, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function and KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling pathway in PD models were detected through molecular biology methods to assess the effect and downstream mechanisms of EPS on PD. Molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance and cellular thermal shift assay were used to verify the direct binding of EPS and KEAP1. We found that EPS exhibited potent antiparkinsonian activity in PD models both in vivo and in vitro. PD models treated with EPS manifested alleviated oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, we found EPS activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway which contributed to DAergic neurons survival in PD models. Particularly, we firstly confirmed that EPS competitively binds to KEAP1 and enhanced its degradation, thereby activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Collectively, EPS attenuates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction by directly binding KEAP1 to activate the KEAP1/Nrf2 signaling pathway, further reducing DAergic neurons damage. These findings suggest that EPS has great potential to become a therapeutic for PD as a clinically effective and safe medicine.",

      "abstract": "Vascular dementia is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder induced by a variety of factors. Currently, there are no definitive treatments for the cognitive dysfunction associated with vascular dementia. However, early detection and preventive measures have proven effective in reducing the risk of onset and improving patient prognosis. Nitric oxide plays an integral role in various physiological and pathological processes within the central nervous system. In recent years, nitric oxide has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and has emerged as a crucial factor in the pathophysiology of vascular dementia. At different stages of vascular dementia, nitric oxide levels and bioavailability undergo dynamic alterations, with a marked reduction in the later stages, which significantly contributes to the cognitive deficits associated with the disease. This review provides a comprehensive review of the emerging role of nitric oxide in the physiological and pathological processes underlying vascular dementia, focusing on its effects on synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and blood\u2012brain barrier integrity. Furthermore, we suggest that targeting the nitric oxide soluble guanylate cyclase-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway through specific therapeutic strategies may offer a novel approach for treating vascular dementia, potentially improving both cognitive function and patient prognosis. The review contributes to a better understanding of the multifaceted role of nitric oxide in vascular dementia and to offering insights into future therapeutic interventions.",

However, the ability to metabolize Uros varies among individuals. This Review provides a comprehensive insight into the synthesis, encapsulation and bioactivities of Uros, focusing on their biotransformation <i>in vivo</i>. We highlight the critical role of gut microbiota in the biotransformation of urolithins, including primary bacterial species such as <i>Gordonibacter urolithinfaciens</i>, <i>Enterocloster bolteae</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of Uros in alleviating neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy is discussed. Finally, several encapsulation strategies for enhancing the solubility and bioavailability of Uros are summarized. Future research direction includes identifying key genes involved in Uros biotransformation, elucidating the bioactive mechanisms of Uros, and improving their bioavailability. In conclusion, we synthesized biosynthetic pathways and bioactive properties of Uros for better utilization in health management.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress, a pivotal driver of neurodegenerative diseases, results from an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular antioxidant defenses. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of key oxidative stress sources, focusing on NADPH oxidase (NOX) hyperactivity and mitochondrial Uncoupling Protein (UCP) downregulation. Critically, we examine the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals in mitigating NOX-mediated ROS generation through direct enzyme inhibition, including impacts on NOX subunit assembly and gene expression. Furthermore, we explore the ability of phytochemicals to bolster cellular antioxidant defenses by activating the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway, elucidating the upregulation of antioxidant genes, such as GPx, SOD, CAT, and HO-1. This review expands beyond confined overviews; emphasizes specific molecular interactions between phytochemicals and target proteins, including NOX isoforms; and provides an in-depth analysis of the specific antioxidant genes upregulated via Nrf2. This approach aims to pave the way for targeted and translatable therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, this review illuminates the intricate molecular dynamics of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases; underscores the potential of phytochemicals to restore redox homeostasis and reverse pathological conditions through precise modulation of key signaling pathways.",

      "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons in the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. About 10% of familial ALS cases are linked to pathogenetic substitution in <i>TARDBP</i>, the gene encoding the TDP-43 protein. A novel rare causative variant in <i>TARDBP</i> (p.G376D) was recently reported in ALS patients. It leads to TDP-43 cytoplasmic mislocalization, increased oxidative stress and reduced cell viability. However, functional studies on the effects of this molecular defect have not yet been carried out. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, and their deregulation has emerged as a key factor in many diseases, among which is ALS. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the impact of this causative variant on mitochondria. In cellular models expressing TDP-43<sup>G376D</sup> and in fibroblasts derived from patients carrying this molecular defect, we observed alterations of mitochondrial functionality. We demonstrated increased localization of the mutated protein to mitochondria and a reduced abundance of subunits of complex I and complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, associated with a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, in cellular respiration and in cytochrome C oxidase (COX) activity. Moreover, ALS cells showed increased mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced abundance of antioxidant enzymes causing increased oxidative stress. These results expand our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying ALS pathogenesis associated with TDP-43 p.G376D and could help to identify new therapeutic strategies to counteract this disease.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are of great importance in cell biology since they are major sites of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and are widely involved in different cellular pathways involved in the response to stress. During ATP production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be produced. While a small amount of ROS may be important for the regulation of physiological processes, at elevated levels they can turn into harmful agents leading to cellular damage. From a pathological perspective, it could be particularly interesting to focus on mitochondrial function in endothelial cells since they may be involved in the development of aging and in the onset of different diseases, including renal, cardio-metabolic, liver and neurodegenerative ones. However, to date, there are no surveys which address the above issues. To fill this gap, it may be valuable to collect recent findings about the role of mitochondria in the regulation of endothelial function, not only to increase knowledge about it but also for clinical applications. Here, we overview the most recent knowledge about the above issues in the view of characterizing the role of mitochondria in endothelial cells as an innovative potential target for the prevention of aging, as well as the treatment of the above pathological conditions.",

      "abstract": "N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL), a derivative of the branched-chain amino acid leucine, has shown therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases, including in prodromal stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanism of its protective effects has been largely unknown. Using discovery-based proteomics, we found that treatment with NALL led to upregulation of lysosomal, mitochondrial, and synaptic proteins in PD patient-derived dopaminergic neurons. NALL reduced levels of pathological pS129-alpha-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons from patients harboring GBA1 or LRRK2 mutations. This decrease in pS129-syn was dependent on serine protease HTRA1 that was induced by NALL treatment of dopaminergic neurons. NALL also upregulated expression of wild-type parkin in both GBA1 and LRRK2 mutant neurons, leading to an increase in functional dopamine transporter and synaptic membrane-associated synaptojanin-1, suggesting improved synaptic function. Furthermore, NALL treatment of mutant LRRK2<sup>R1441C</sup> knock-in mice led to decreased pS129-alpha-synuclein, increased parkin and improved dopamine-dependent motor learning deficits. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of NALL in PD by its protective effects on \u03b1-synuclein pathology and synaptic function in vulnerable dopaminergic neurons.",

      "title": "Mindful Eating: A Deep Insight Into Fructose Metabolism and Its Effects on Appetite Regulation and Brain Function.",
      "abstract": "Fructose, a common sweetener in modern diets, has profound effects on both metabolism and brain function, primarily due to its distinct metabolic pathways. Unlike glucose, fructose bypasses critical regulatory steps in metabolism, particularly the phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) feedback inhibition, leading to uncontrolled metabolism and increased fat storage. This review delves into the metabolic consequences of fructose consumption, including its limited role in directly stimulating insulin secretion, which affects satiety signaling and contributes to increased food intake. The small intestine initially helps metabolize ingested fructose, shielding the liver and brain from excessive exposure. However, when consumed in excess, particularly in diets high in processed foods, this protective mechanism becomes overwhelmed, contributing to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, obesity, and fatty liver disease. The review also explores fructose's impact on the brain, with a focus on the hippocampus, a key region for memory and learning. Chronic high fructose intake has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neuroinflammation, all of which contribute to cognitive decline and impairments in memory and learning. Additionally, fructose-induced alterations in insulin signaling in the brain are associated with increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases. These findings underscore the potential long-term neurological consequences of excessive fructose intake and highlight the need for further human studies to assess the full spectrum of its effects on brain health. Addressing the rising consumption of fructose, particularly in processed foods, is essential for developing targeted strategies to mitigate its adverse metabolic and cognitive outcomes.",

      "title": "MSH2 is not required for either maintenance of DNA methylation or repeat contraction at the FMR1 locus in fragile X syndrome or the FXN locus in Friedreich's ataxia.",
      "abstract": "Repeat-induced epigenetic changes are observed in many repeat expansion disorders (REDs). These changes result in transcriptional deficits and/or silencing of the associated gene. MSH2, a mismatch repair protein that is required for repeat expansion in the REDs, has been implicated in the maintenance of DNA methylation seen in the region upstream of the expanded CTG repeats at the DMPK locus in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Here, we investigated the role of MSH2 in aberrant DNA methylation in two additional REDs, fragile X syndrome (FXS) that is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) that is caused by a GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin (FXN) gene. In contrast to what is seen at the DMPK locus in DM1, loss of MSH2 did not decrease DNA methylation at the FMR1 promoter in FXS embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or increase FMR1 transcription. This difference was not due to the differences in the CpG density of the two loci as a decrease in DNA methylation was also not observed in a less CpG dense region upstream of the expanded GAA repeats in the FXN gene in MSH2 null induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from FRDA patient fibroblasts. Surprisingly, given previous reports, we found that FMR1 reactivation was associated with a high frequency of MSH2-independent CGG-repeat contractions that resulted a permanent loss of DNA methylation. MSH2-independent GAA-repeat contractions were also seen in FRDA cells. Our results suggest that there are mechanistic differences in the way that DNA methylation is maintained in the region upstream of expanded repeats among different REDs even though they share a similar mechanism of repeat expansion. The high frequency of transcription-induced MSH2-dependent and MSH2-independent contractions we have observed may contribute to the mosaicism that is frequently seen in carriers of FMR1 alleles with expanded CGG-repeat tracts. These contractions may reflect the underlying problems associated with transcription through the repeat. Given the recent interest in the therapeutic use of transcription-driven repeat contractions, our data may have interesting mechanistic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "This review examines the neuroprotective potential of paddy rice bioactive compounds, with a focus on antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroregenerative properties that may aid in preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Key compounds analyzed include tocotrienols, gamma-oryzanol, and phenolic acids. We conducted a comprehensive review of existing studies detailing the mechanisms by which paddy rice bioactives support brain health. These compounds were examined for their effects on oxidative stress reduction, neuroinflammation modulation, neurotransmitter regulation, and neurogenesis promotion. Bioactives such as gamma-oryzanol and ferulic acid were found to decrease neuroinflammatory markers and support neurotransmitter function. Research shows paddy rice compounds enhance neural resilience and cognitive function, suggesting their potential role in managing disorders like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. While preclinical evidence underscores the therapeutic promise of paddy rice bioactives, further clinical studies are needed to confirm efficacy, establish optimal dosages, and improve bioavailability. This review advocates for advanced nutraceutical development using paddy rice to bridge preclinical findings and clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Neuronal death is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA becomes damaged when processes such as replication, repair, and nucleotide synthesis are compromised. This extensive accumulation of damaged mitochondrial DNA subsequently disrupts the normal function of mitochondria, leading to aging, degeneration, or even death of neurons. Mitochondrial dysfunction stands as a pivotal factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recognizing the intricate nature of their pathogenesis, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic interventions. In recent years, mitochondrial DNA editing tools such as zinc finger nucleases, double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A-derived cytosine base editors, and transcription activator-like effector ligand deaminases have emerged. Their emergence will revolutionize the research and treatment of mitochondrial diseases. In this review, we summarize the advancements in mitochondrial base editing technology and anticipate its utilization in neurodegenerative diseases, offering insights that may inform preventive strategies and therapeutic interventions for disease phenotypes.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders present a significant challenge to healthcare systems, mainly due to the limited availability of effective treatment options to halt or reverse disease progression. Endogenous steroids synthesized in the central nervous system, such as pregnenolone (PREG), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), progesterone (PROG), and allopregnanolone (ALLO), have been identified as potential therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. Neurosteroids such as ALLO, DHEA, and PROG, as well as their synthetic analogs like Ganaxolene, Fluasterone, and Olexoxime, offer promising effects for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. Moreover, Brexanolone and Ganaxolone are synthetic steroids approved for the treatment of postpartum depression and epilepsy, respectively. Neurosteroids such as ALLO are crucial in modulating GABAergic neurotransmission and reducing neuroinflammation. These compounds enhance the activity of GABA-A receptors, leading to increased inhibitory signaling in the brain, which can help regulate mood, cognition, and neuroprotection. Small clinical trials and observational studies indicate that ALLO may have cognitive benefits, but no large-scale, definitive meta-analysis confirms a 20\u202f% improvement in AD patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological diseases due to the high-energy demand and sensitivity of neurons to oxidative stress. Reduced mitochondrial function leads to amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles accumulation in AD. In Parkinson's disease (PD), mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from the PINK1 or Parkin genes leads to energy deficiencies and the accumulation of toxic byproducts. Mutations in genes such as SOD1, C9orf72, and TDP-43 have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, studies on these neurodegenerative diseases suggest that inflammation is not merely a consequence of neurodegeneration but is also an essential factor in this process. Many neurological disorders involve multifaceted interactions between genetics, the environment, and immune responses, making it difficult to pinpoint their exact causes. Future research aims to overcome these hurdles through genetic advances, regenerative medicine, and personalized therapies. Cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and high-throughput screening are expected to accelerate drug discovery and improve diagnostic accuracy. Increasing collaboration between interdisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics, neuroscience, and immunology will lead to innovative treatment strategies. This comprehensive review discusses the therapeutic effects of enzymes, neurosteroids, and synthetic steroids in different neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD, PD, ALS, and MS. Potential challenges in the therapeutic use of neurosteroids, such as the limited bioavailability and off-target effects of synthetic steroids, are also discussed, and an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the impact of these steroids on neurodegenerative disorders is presented.",

      "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system might cooperate with each other on various levels in a body. Interestingly, signaling pathways linked to several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to be involved in the pathology both of CNS disorders including neurodegenerative diseases and/or immune-related diseases. Oxidative stress and inflammation are likely to contribute to cell damage and death in these disorders, which in turn could cause mitochondrial injury. Interestingly, it has been revealed that gut microbiota could play a significant role in changing the phenotype of various neuron and/or immune-related disorders. Remarkably, GPCR signaling has been recognized as a key upstream regulator for autophagy/mitophagy via the action of the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In addition, adjusting the composition of gut microbiota could be applied to modulate the autophagy/mitophagy by the alteration of GPCR signaling to ameliorate the mitochondrial injury. Collectively, this approach may contribute to the innovative development of promising therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases and/or immune-related diseases. This review describes that concept, highlighting the intracellular mTOR signaling from the cell surface GPCRs within cells of Gut-brain-immune axis.",

In recent years augmentation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) has emerged as a promising disease-modifying strategy that targets multiple key disease pathways across multiple NDDs, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, energy deficits, proteostasis, and neuroinflammation. Several early clinical trials of NAD augmentation have been completed, and many more are currently underway, reflecting the growing optimism and urgency within the field. We discuss the rationale and evolving therapeutic landscape of NAD augmentation. We argue that, to fully realize its therapeutic potential, it is essential to determine the specific contexts in which NAD supplementation is most effective and to address crucial knowledge gaps.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a natural biological process, but evidence suggests that some aspects of aging can be delayed and reduce the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, for which aging is a key risk factor. In a neuronal Caenorhabditis elegans model of a Polyglutamine disease-Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)- we assessed the hypothesis that delaying aging is neuroprotective, investigating the effect of genetically manipulating multiple lifespan-determinant mechanisms. Lifespan-increasing mutations causing insulin/IGF-1 signaling downregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, germline ablation and dietary restriction/innate immune activation had distinct impacts on MJD/SCA3 phenotypes, suggesting that not all genetic strategies of stalling aging are equally neuroprotective and challenging the idea that delaying aging is a guaranteed therapy for these diseases. Lifespan-extension improved the SCA3/MJD motor phenotype only when induced by altered nutrient-sensing pathways such as those mediated by insulin/IGF-1 and eat-2 signaling, but their effects on neuronal aggregation differed. These pathways exhibited differential proteostasis profiles, but both activated the heat shock response suggesting that they operate through partially independent mechanisms to confer neuroprotection. The therapeutic value of the insulin/IGF-1 downregulation was demonstrated through the chronic treatment of the SCA3/MJD model with an insulin/IGF-1 signaling inhibitor, underscoring the relevance of aging manipulations in guiding therapeutic strategies for these diseases.",

      "abstract": "Hypercholesterolemia is a recognized comorbidity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet its mechanistic connection to AD pathology, particularly its impact on microglial function and amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) dynamics remains unclear. To investigate this, we utilized the APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> (AK) mouse model, which develops robust A\u03b2 pathology, and the APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup>;LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> (AL<sup>KO</sup>) model, which combines A\u03b2 pathology with LDL receptor deficiency to induce hypercholesterolemia under a Western diet (WD). These models were designed to study the combined effects of genetic predisposition and dietary factors on AD progression. At six months of age, mice were maintained on a control diet or switched to a WD for two months to induce hypercholesterolemia. Our findings demonstrate that hypercholesterolemia suppresses microglial responses to A\u03b2 plaques, evidenced by reduced clustering and activation of microglia around plaques. The combination of WD and LDLR deficiency synergistically diminished the expression of disease-associated microglia markers, resulting in reduced A\u03b2 plaque compactness. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing revealed hypercholesterolemia impaired microglial mitochondrial function, reduced protein synthesis, and heightened neuroinflammation. Lipidomic profiling revealed significant changes in the microglial lipidome, including elevated ceramides, hexosylceramides, and lysophosphatidylcholine, along with reduced N-acylethanolamines, reflecting a pro-inflammatory and metabolically stressed microglial state. Behavioral analyses further revealed that both WD and LDLR deficiency independently and synergistically impaired cognitive performance and increased anxiety-like behaviors in AD mice. Together, this study highlights the role of hypercholesterolemia in exacerbating AD pathology by disrupting microglial function, altering lipid metabolism, and impairing cognitive function, and suggests that pharmacological management of hypercholesterolemia could slow AD progression.",

      "abstract": "This comprehensive review examines the therapeutic potential of metformin, a well-established diabetes medication, in treating neurodegenerative disorders. Originally used as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, recent studies have begun investigating metformin's effects beyond metabolic disorders, particularly its neuroprotective capabilities against conditions like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Key findings demonstrate that metformin's neuroprotective effects operate through multiple pathways: AMPK activation enhancing cellular energy metabolism and autophagy; upregulation of antioxidant defenses; suppression of inflammation; inhibition of protein aggregation; and improvement of mitochondrial function. These mechanisms collectively address common pathological features in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, including oxidative stress, protein accumulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Clinical and preclinical evidence supporting metformin's association with improved cognitive performance, reduced risk of dementia, and modulation of pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases is critically evaluated. While metformin shows promise as a therapeutic agent, this review emphasizes the need for further investigation to fully understand its mechanisms and optimal therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness is increasingly recognized as a critical regulator of cellular behaviour, governing processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impaired autophagy, and progressive softening of the brain tissue, yet research into how mechanical cues influence cellular metabolism in this context remains scarce. In this study, we evaluated the long-term effects of brain-compliant, soft ECM on mitochondrial bioenergetics, redox balance, and autophagic capacity in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and mouse hippocampal (HT22) cell lines, as well as primary mouse neurons. We observed that prolonged exposure to soft ECM does not impact cell proliferative capacity of neuronal cells but results in mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction, redox imbalance, and disrupted autophagic flux. These findings were consistently validated across both human and mouse neuronal cells. Our data indicate a decreased maximal autophagic capacity in cells exposed to long-term soft ECM, potentially due to an imbalance in autophagosome formation and degradation, as demonstrated by decreased LC3 II levels following chloroquine-induced autophagic flux inhibition. This impairment in autophagy was coupled with increased cellular oxidative stress, further indicating metabolic alterations. These findings emphasize the critical role of ECM stiffness in regulating neuronal cell metabolism and suggest that prolonged exposure to soft ECM may mimic key aspects of neurodegenerative disease pathology, thereby enhancing the physiological relevance of in\u00a0vitro models. This study underscores the necessity for further research into ECM mechanics as a contributing factor in neurodegenerative disease progression and as a potential target for therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are vital for energy production, metabolic regulation, and cellular signaling. Their dysfunction is strongly implicated in neurological, cardiovascular, and muscular degenerative diseases, where energy deficits and oxidative stress accelerate disease progression. Platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs), once called \"platelet dust\", have emerged as promising agents for mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction. Like other extracellular vesicles (EVs), PEVs carry diverse molecular cargo and surface markers implicated in disease processes and therapeutic efficacy. Notably, they may possibly contain intact or partially functional mitochondrial components, making them tentatively attractive for targeting mitochondrial damage. Although direct research on PEVs-mediated mitochondrial rescue remains limited, current evidence suggests that PEVs can modulate diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and potentially enhance mitochondrial health. This review explores the therapeutic potential of PEVs in neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders, highlighting their role in restoring mitochondrial health. By examining recent advancements in PEVs research, we aim to shed light on novel strategies for utilizing PEVs as therapeutic agents. Our goal is to underscore the importance of further fundamental and applied research into PEVs-based interventions, as innovative tools for combating a wide range of diseases linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Maintaining mitochondrial function plays a crucial role in preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases. CDGSH iron-sulfur domain 1 (CISD1), a NEET family protein localized on the mitochondrial outer membrane, regulates mitochondrial iron transport. However, the precise mechanism by which CISD1 modulates mitochondrial Fe<sup>2\u202f+</sup> remains unclear. In this study, we examine the link between aberrant iron metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction using in vivo and in vitro excitotoxicity models. Our study also clarifies how CISD1 modulates KA-mediated excitotoxic neuronal damage. Overexpression of CISD1 reverses KA-induced mitochondrial iron overload and dysfunction. KA significantly downregulate the mitochondrial protein deacetylase SIRT1. SRT1460 (SIRT1-specific agonist) mitigates mitochondrial iron overload and restore CISD1 expression levels. Altogether, CISD1 protects against excitotoxic injury by mitigating mitochondrial iron overload, thereby providing a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a slow and irreversible biological process leading to decreased cell and tissue functions with higher risks of multiple age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. It is widely accepted that aging represents the leading risk factor for neurodegeneration. The pathogenesis of these diseases involves complex interactions of genetic mutations, environmental factors, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which complicate treatment with traditional mono-targeted therapies. Network pharmacology can help identify potential gene or protein targets related to neurodegenerative diseases. Integrating advanced molecular profiling technologies and computer-aided drug design further enhances the potential of network pharmacology, enabling the identification of biomarkers and therapeutic targets, thus paving the way for precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases. This review article delves into\u00a0the application of network pharmacology in understanding and treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and spinal muscular atrophy. Overall, this article emphasizes the importance of addressing aging as a central factor in developing effective disease-modifying therapies, highlighting how network pharmacology can unravel the complex biological networks associated with aging and pave the way for personalized medical strategies.",

      "abstract": "Numerous epidemiological studies indicate that populations exposed to environmental toxicants such as heavy metals have a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to those unexposed, indicating a potential association between heavy metals exposure and AD. The aim of this review is to summarize contemporary mechanistic research exploring the associations of four important metals, arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd), with AD and possible pathways, processes, and molecular mechanisms on the basis of data from the most recent mechanistic studies. Primary research publications published during the last decade were identified via a search of the PubMed Database. A thorough literature search and final screening yielded 45 original research articles for this review. Of the 45 research articles, 6 pertain to As, 9 to Mn, 21 to Pb, and 9 to Cd exposures and AD pathobiology. Environmental exposure to these heavy metals induces a wide range of pathological processes that intersect with well-known mechanisms leading to AD, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, autophagy dysfunction, and tau hyperphosphorylation. While exposure to single metals shares some affected pathways, certain effects are unique to specific metals. For instance, Pb disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and mitochondrial functions and alters AD-related genes epigenetically. Cd triggers neuronal senescence via p53/p21/Rb. As disrupts nitric oxide (NO) signaling, cortical, and synaptic function. Mn causes glutamate excitotoxicity and dopamine neuron damage. Our review provides a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms showing how metals contribute to AD. Information regarding the potential metal-induced toxicity relevant to AD may help us develop effective therapeutic AD intervention, treatment, and prevention.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, detrimental immune response, and neuroinflammation are mainly responsible for the injury and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brains of patients suffering from PD. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for treating PD due to their ability to suppress the activation of inflammatory immune cells and enhance the viability and function of dopamine-producing neurons. MSC-EVs can easily bypass the blood-brain barrier and deliver their cargo (neuroprotective factors, immunosuppressive proteins, and microRNAs) to injured dopamine-producing neurons and brain-infiltrated inflammatory immune cells. A large number of recently published experimental studies demonstrated that MSC-EVs efficiently alleviated PD-related motor and behavioral deficits in animal models, indicating that MSC-EVs should be considered as potentially new therapeutic agents for the treatment of PD. Accordingly, in this review article, we summarized current knowledge about the therapeutic potential of MSCs-EVs in the treatment of PD, paving the way for their future clinical use in the treatment of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily marked by amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaque accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles, which lead to cognitive decline. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are key contributors to the disease's progression, with elevated production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) exacerbating neuronal damage. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a naturally occurring antioxidant, has been identified for its potential neuroprotective effects due to its roles in mitochondrial function, energy production, and antioxidant defense. The cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) is also implicated in AD, promoting neuroinflammation by disrupting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and activating glial cells. This review explores the impact of CoQ10 on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in AD, focusing on its role in mitigating IL-17-mediated pathways. Preclinical studies indicate that CoQ10 reduces A\u03b2 plaques, improves cognitive functions, and restores mitochondrial stability. However, clinical trials have yielded mixed results, often limited by bioavailability challenges. This research highlights the necessity of further human trials better to understand CoQ10's therapeutic potential in AD management.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD). Our goal was to develop practical, noninvasive methods to assess mitochondrial status through the detection of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs). We explored blood-borne MDVs, a recently identified class of extracellular vesicles, as potential biomarkers for CNS mitochondrial status. The study identified MDVs from neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes specifically in human plasma. A novel nanoflow cytometry was developed to evaluate the level of neuron-, astrocyte-, and oligodendrocyte-derived MDVs in plasma in AD and PD patients. Importantly, analyses of discovery and validation cohorts revealed significantly lower brain cell-specific MDVs in AD and PD patients compared to healthy controls. This study suggests that blood MDVs could serve as noninvasive biomarkers for mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, PD, and beyond, potentially aiding in monitoring mitochondrial-focused therapies for neurological disorders.",

      "abstract": "Age-related decline in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-a central regulator of cellular metabolism, DNA repair, and immune homeostasis-is strongly associated with physiological dysfunction. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a potent NAD+ precursor, shows promise in counteracting aging-related pathologies, particularly neurodegenerative decline. An aging model was established in mice through 8-week D-galactose (D-gal) exposure, followed by NMN oral supplementation. Behavioral outcomes (open field test, Morris water maze) were analyzed alongside oxidative stress markers (SOD, CAT, AGEs), inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10), and neurotransmitters (LC-MS/MS). Apoptotic activity (TUNEL, p16/p21), mitochondrial regulators (Sirt1, p-AMPK, PGC-1\u03b1), and intestinal barrier integrity (HE/AB-PAS staining) were evaluated. Sirt1 dependency was confirmed using inhibitor Ex527. NMN restored locomotor activity and spatial memory in D-gal mice without altering body weight. Mechanistically, NMN synergistically attenuated oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, elevating antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT) and IL-10 while suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and AGEs. Cortical/hippocampal analyses revealed reduced apoptosis (TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells) and senescence markers (p16, p21), with enhanced mitochondrial function via Sirt1/AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1 activation (Sirt1, p-AMPK). NMN concurrently preserved intestinal mucosal architecture, mitigating D-gal-induced barrier disruption. Crucially, all benefits were abolished by Sirt1 inhibition, confirming pathway specificity. Our findings establish NMN as a multifaceted therapeutic agent that preserves neurocognitive function and intestinal homeostasis in aging models by orchestrating antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic responses through Sirt1/AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1 activation. This work provides translational insights into NAD+-boosting strategies for age-related disorders.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by significant cognitive impairment and predominantly affects the elderly. With no effective cure available, research continues to explore novel therapeutic and preventive strategies. Recently, palmitic acid-hydroxystearic acids (PAHSAs), especially their stereochemistry S-configuration, have shown potential as a dietary supplement with anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties. We previously found that one of the PAHSAs, 9-PAHSA, could improve cognitive impairment in the high-fat-diet mice, however, whether it has an equal effect on AD-like mice remains unclear. Since mitochondrial dysfunction is recognized as a significant pathological feature of AD, with impaired mitophagy leading to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, thus exacerbating disease progression, in this study, we evaluated the effects of the chiral isomer of 9-PAHSA, S-9-PAHSA, on cognitive dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction in 5xFAD mice. Three-month-old mice were treated with S-9-PAHSA 30\u2009mg/kg in their drinking water for 3\u2009months. Behavioral studies were conducted using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, followed by assessments of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) plaque deposition, neuronal apoptosis, and mitochondrial function. We found that S-9-PAHSA significantly enhanced spatial learning and memory abilities, reduced amyloid plaque deposition, decreased neuronal apoptosis, and improved mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy in 5xFAD mice. These findings suggest that S-9-PAHSA holds promise as a supplementary preventive and therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.",

      "abstract": "The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) is a biomarker of inflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases, widely regarded to be upregulated in the aging brain. Here we investigated the interaction between aging and TSPO immunomodulatory function in the mouse hippocampus, a region severely affected in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Surprisingly, we found that TSPO levels were decreased in brain innate immune populations in aging. Aging resulted in a reversal of TSPO knockout transcriptional signatures following inflammatory insult. TSPO deletion drastically exacerbated inflammatory transcriptional responses in the aging hippocampus, while dampening inflammation in the young hippocampus. This age-dependent effect of TSPO was linked to NF-k\u03b2 and interferon regulatory transcriptional networks. Drugs that disrupt the cell cycle and induce DNA damage, such as heat shock protein and topoisomerase inhibitors, were identified to mimic the inflammatory transcriptional signature characterizing aging in TSPO knockout mice most closely. These findings indicate that TSPO plays a protective role in brain aging. This TSPO-aging interaction is an important consideration in the interpretation of TSPO-targeted biomarker and therapeutic studies, as well as in\u00a0vitro studies that cannot model the aging brain.",

      "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the motor neurons, causing progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. While research has focused on understanding pathological mechanisms in the motor cortex and spinal cord, there is growing evidence that extra-motor brain regions may also play a role in the pathogenesis or progression of ALS. We generated 165 sample-matched post-mortem brain transcriptomes from 22 sporadic ALS patients with pTDP-43 pathological staging and 11 non-neurological controls. For each individual, five brain regions underwent mRNA sequencing: motor cortex (pTDP-43 inclusions always present), prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (pTDP-43 inclusions sometimes present), and occipital cortex and cerebellum (pTDP-43 inclusions rarely present). We examined gene expression, cell-type composition, transcript usage (% contribution of a transcript to total gene expression) and alternative splicing, comparing ALS-specific changes between brain regions. We also considered whether post-mortem pTDP-43 pathological stage classification defined ALS subgroups with distinct gene expression profiles. Significant gene expression changes were observed in ALS cases for all five brain regions, with the cerebellum demonstrating the largest number of total (>\u20093,000) and unique (60%) differentially expressed genes. Pathway enrichment and predicted activity were largely concordant across brain regions, suggesting that ALS-linked mechanisms, including inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, are also dysregulated in non-motor brain regions. Switches in transcript usage were identified for a small set of genes including increased usage of a POLDIP3 transcript, associated with TDP-43 loss-of-function, in the cerebellum and a XBP1 transcript, indicative of unfolded protein response activity, in the motor cortex. Extensive variation in RNA splicing was identified in the ALS brain, with 26-41% of alternatively spliced genes unique to a given brain region. This included detection of TDP-43-associated cryptic splicing events such as the STMN2 cryptic exon which was shown to have a pTDP-43 pathology-specific expression pattern. Finally, ALS patients with stage 4 pTDP-43 pathology demonstrated distinct gene and protein expression changes in the cerebellum. Together our findings highlighted widespread transcriptome alterations in ALS post-mortem brain and showed that, despite the absence of pTDP-43 pathology in the cerebellum, extensive and pTDP-43 pathological stage-specific RNA changes are evident in this brain region.",

      "abstract": "Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), a leading common inherited optic neuropathy, arises from progressive retinal ganglion cell degeneration, often linked to OPA1 mutations. OPA1, a mitochondrial GTPase, regulates mitochondrial fusion, crista structure, and apoptosis. While GTPase-related dysfunction is well-studied, the role of other OPA1 domains in ADOA pathology remains unclear. To investigate ADOA-linked OPA1 mutations, we assessed mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and cell viability in primary cortical neurons and N2a cells expressing OPA1 wild-type or mutant constructs. RNA sequencing and structural predictions (SWISS-MODEL) provided insights into molecular pathways and structural impacts. Two ADOA-associated mutations were characterized: V465F (GTPase \u03b2-fold) and V560F (BSE \u03b1-helix). Both mutations impaired mitochondrial fusion and cell survival under apoptotic stimuli. Notably, the BSE-located V560F mutation caused greater deficits in membrane potential maintenance, earlier apoptosis, and distinct molecular pathway changes compared to V465F. This study highlights the domain-specific impacts of OPA1 mutations on mitochondrial function and ADOA pathology, revealing unique roles of the BSE domain in apoptosis regulation and mitochondrial integrity. These findings provide insights into ADOA mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive uncurable neurodegenerative pathology affecting millions worldwide. Photobiomodulation and Taurine are promising alternatives for preventing and reducing the rapid progression of neurodegeneration, stimulating the reconstructing of neural tissue structures, especially improving mitochondrial activity, which is highly impaired in AD. In this study, the mitochondrial effects of Taurine combined with light emitting diode (LED) irradiation were evaluated on human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), under oxidative stress condition by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) exposure, a considerable modulator in AD. We evaluated LED irradiation at the wavelength of 660\u00a0nm and Taurine under different concentrations before and together with exposing SH-SY5Y cells to different concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, assessing mitochondrial activity by the MTT colorimetric test and labeling live cells mitochondria by the fluorescent probe MitoTracker. Cell viability was also evaluated by the trypan blue exclusion assay, and cellular morphological structures were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Neuroprotective effects were achieved by both LED irradiation and LED irradiation\u2009+\u2009Taurine when cells were exposed to them before H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced stress. Comparing both agents, LED irradiation at 660\u00a0nm is sufficient to improve mitochondrial activity, however, healthy mitochondrial morphology was only observed when cells were treated with Taurine together with LED irradiation, representing affordable candidates that act in synergy against oxidative stress, one of the main contributors to neurodegeneration.",

      "abstract": "Glaucoma is a group of irreversible neurodegenerative disorders of the optic nerve, characterized by distinct optic nerve damage and progressive visual field loss, with its pathological foundation involving the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and axonal degeneration. Neuroinflammation driven by the polarization of retinal microglia significantly contributes to RGCs apoptosis. This study investigates the neuroprotective effects of the SIRT6 activator MDL800 on microglial polarization in experimental glaucoma. We used a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 microglial inflammation model and an ocular hypertension (OHT) rat model. The regulatory effects of MDL800 on BV2 cell M1/M2 polarization were evaluated. After inhibiting SIRT6, MDL800's impact on MAPK and AMPK-Nrf2-HO-1/NQO-1 pathways was studied. A co-culture system of BV2 cells and retinal precursor cells R28 was established to observe the effect of MDL800-regulated BV2 cell polarization on R28 cell survival. In the rat model, the effects of MDL800 on microglial polarization, retinal structure, and RGCs apoptosis in glaucoma were assessed. MDL800 facilitated BV2 cell polarization from M1 to M2 under LPS stimulation, exerting anti-inflammatory effects. It activated SIRT6 to regulate BV2 cell polarization by inhibiting the MAPK pathway and activating the AMPK-Nrf2-HO-1/NQO-1 axis. In a co-culture system of BV2 cells and R28 cells, MDL800 regulated the release of LPS-induced inflammatory factors by mediating the polarization of BV2 cells, which in turn inhibited the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in R28 cells and promoted their survival. In the OHT rat model, MDL800 significantly inhibited retinal microglia proliferation and activation, promoted their polarization from M1 to M2, and reduced RGCs apoptosis. MDL800 shows promise for clinical development and treatment of glaucoma.",

      "abstract": "Microglia are crucial for CNS homeostasis and are involved in a wide range of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. Systemic inflammation and infections can contribute to neurodegeneration later in life by affecting microglia. Like other innate immune cells, microglia can develop innate immune memory (IIM) in response to an inflammatory challenge, altering their response to subsequent stimuli. IIM can ameliorate or worsen CNS pathology, but it is unclear if IIM can be reversed to restore microglia functions. Here, we investigated whether microglia depletion-repopulation by inhibition of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor with BLZ945 reversed LPS-induced microglia endotoxin tolerance in mice. Repopulated microglia displayed a reduced expression of homeostatic genes and genes related to mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle metabolism and an increased expression of immune effector and activation genes. Nonetheless, the blunted inflammatory gene response after LPS-preconditioning was retained after a depletion-repopulation cycle. Our study highlights the persistence of endotoxin tolerance in microglia after a depletion-repopulation cycle, which might impact the potential effectiveness of strategies targeted at microglia depletion for clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cerebral insulin resistance. Even though approximately 95\u00a0% of AD cases are reported as sporadic, the exact pathogenesis remains sparse. Tranilast, an analogue of tryptophan metabolite, was initially endowed as an anti-allergic agent and used in multiple inflammatory ailments. Still, the molecular mechanisms targeting sAD are yet to be investigated. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective potential of tranilast by performing biochemical, molecular and histopathological assessments using both in vivo and in vitro experimental sAD models. Streptozotocin (STZ; 3\u00a0mg/kg) was bilaterally injected on day 1 and 3 through the intracerebroventricular (ICV) route to Sprague Dawley rats for the in vivo model induction. Spontaneous alternation test, novel object recognition test, and passive avoidance test were performed to assess the altered behavioural patterns in animals. Furthermore, human neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y) were exposed to STZ (1\u00a0mM) and tranilast for 24\u00a0h to validate the in vivo results. Three weeks of tranilast (30 and 100\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) treatment improved neurobehavioural anomalies in ICV-STZ-treated rats by halting neuroinflammation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation caused by enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thioredoxin interaction protein (TXNIP) overexpression. The phosphorylated tau (p-tau S416) level was also increased in the ICV-STZ rat's hippocampus and reversed upon tranilast treatment. A high dose of tranilast (100\u00a0mg/kg) treatment sensitised hippocampal insulin signalling in ICV-STZ-treated rats. Furthermore, in cell culture studies, 24-h tranilast (30 and 100\u00a0\u03bcM) treatment reduced the mitochondrial ROS production and attenuated inflammasome activation in STZ-treated SHSY5Y cells. In summary, the findings of the study proclaim the neuroprotective potential of tranilast in STZ induced model of sAD by modulating the TXNIP-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.",

      "abstract": "The global rise in both metabolic syndrome (MetS) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), particularly dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a growing health and socioeconomic burden. MetS affects approximately 25% of the global adult population and is associated with insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, factors increasingly linked to cognitive impairment and brain atrophy. This review explores the shared pathophysiological mechanisms between MetS and NDs, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance in the brain, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, mitochondrial damage, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and alterations in the renin-angiotensin system. In terms of substance, MetS patients are four times more likely to develop dementia, with increased markers such as CRP and IL-6 present in the patient populations. The review suggests the role of astrocytic insulin signalling, adipokines, and toll-like receptors as key molecular links. Interventions such as caloric restriction, hydroxytyrosol (HT), and intranasal insulin have shown promising outcomes at preclinical and early clinical stages. Antidiabetic drugs like metformin, liraglutide, and GLP-1 receptor agonists have the potential to modulate neuroinflammation and improve cognition. Angiotensin receptor blockers like losartan and candesartan also exhibit neuroprotection via RAS pathway modulation. The review emphasizes the need for longitudinal studies and clinical trials to confirm these therapeutic agents and develop effective and cost-friendly interventions for the prevention and management of neurodegeneration in patients with metabolic syndrome.",

      "abstract": "To compare the outcomes between idebenone oral therapy and rAAV2-ND4 intravitreal injection in the treatment of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. A systematic literature review was performed of publications from 1990 to 2023 in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Google Scholar, Embase, CrossRef, OpenAlex, and Web of Science for studies evaluating the outcomes of idebenone or rAAV2-ND4 therapy in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. The primary outcome measure was improvement in visual acuity. Secondary outcome measures were improvement of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, ganglion cell layer volume, and visual field mean deviation. There are no studies directly comparing the two interventions. Our analysis included 645 patients from 17 studies; 338 patients from nine studies received idebenone, and 307 patients from eight studies received rAAV2-ND4. When compared to each other, rAAV2-ND4 provided better visual improvement at 6 months with a mean difference of 0.07 (P = 0.8289), but idebenone provided better visual improvement at 1 year with a mean difference of 0.35 (P < 0.0001). At 2 years, the rAAV2-ND4 group's visual acuity improved from baseline by 0.18 (P = 0.08). There was no data for improvement at 2 years for idebenone, only for rAAV2-ND4. rAAV2-ND4 provides better visual acuity results at 6 months, and idebenone provides better visual acuity results at 1 year. Further studies are recommended to formulate a complete idea about the long-term results (>2 years).",

      "abstract": "Environmental arsenic exposure is closely related to nerve damage. Recent research suggests miR-27a-3p is involved in the development of certain neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Nonetheless, the precise impact of miR-27a-3p on neuron functioning in the hippocampus remains unclear. In this investigation, models were established using NaAsO<sub>2</sub>-treated mice and cells to investigate this aspect. Male C57BL/6J mice were given drinking water containing sodium arsenite (0, 0.5, 5, or 50\u00a0ppm) for 48\u00a0weeks. The results showed that sodium arsenite induced apoptosis in mouse neurons. After 6\u00a0\u03bcmol/L sodium arsenite treatment in HT22 cells, miR-27a-3p expression level was decreased, FTO, DRP1 and p-DRP1 (Ser616), neuronal apoptosis and pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and cleaved asparaginase 3) were increased, and anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and MMP were decreased, which indicated that sodium arsenite could activate FTO/DRP1 pathway. Furthermore the process could be reversed by miR-27a-3p mimics. This study demonstrates that miR-27a-3p alleviates sodium arsenite-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in HT22 cells by inhibiting the FTO/DRP1 pathway. This study provides a scientific basis for finding early biomarkers for the control of arsenic-induced neurotoxicity and discovering new prevention and control measures.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease threatening the life of millions people worldwide. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are the pivotal causative elements of PD. Precise diagnosis enables timely monitoring initiation and progression of PD, thereby facilitating the formulation of customized and targeted treatment strategies. Optical imaging offers one alternative way for PD diagnosis. However, available diagnostic probes suffer from the inability to bypass the blood brain barrier (BBB). To accurately diagnose and effectively combat PD, there is an urgent need to develop an integrated diagnostic and therapeutic nanoprobe that can bypass the BBB and target the factors underlying degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. In present study, one integrated carrier-free nanoprobe HVCur-NPs towards those factors was designed and constructed. By modifying probe side chain with polypeptide, RVG29, we obtained brain-targeting HV-PEG-RVG29. It not only enables BBB penetration, but also produces near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) signals in cascade response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and viscosity. The release of loaded curcumin (CUR) prevents oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and restore mitochondrial function so as to rescue PD phenotypes. In cellular PD model, HVCur-NPs generated NIRF/PA signals in response to elevated ROS and viscosity, and ameliorated cell apoptosis by eliminating ROS and restoring mitochondria function. Moreover, in mice PD model, HVCur-NPs realized in situ NIRF/PA imaging brain, and rescued DA neuron loss and restored the behavioral deficit of PD mice, without detectable biotoxicity. This carrier-free nanoprobe opens venues for integrated diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

We show that intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) regulates axoplasmic viscosity and protein aggregation in mammalian neurons. Decreased intracellular ATP upon mitochondrial inhibition leads to axoterminal cytosol, synaptic vesicles, and active zone component condensation, modulating the functional organization of mouse glutamatergic synapses. Proteins involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) condensed and underwent ATP-dependent liquid phase separation in vitro. Human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from patients with PD and ALS displayed reduced axoplasmic fluidity and decreased intracellular ATP. Last, nicotinamide mononucleotide treatment successfully rescued intracellular ATP levels and axoplasmic viscosity in neurons from patients with PD and ALS and reduced TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregation in human motor neurons derived from a patient with ALS. Thus, our data suggest that the hydrotropic activity of ATP contributes to the regulation of neuronal homeostasis under both physiological and pathological conditions.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by cognitive decline and memory impairment. Recent research highlights the important role of hypoxia, a state of insufficient oxygen availability, in exacerbating AD pathogenesis. Through the use of a number of different search engines like Scopus, PubMed, Bentham, and Elsevier databases, a literature review was carried out for investigating the role of hypoxia mediated pathobiology in AD. Only peerreviewed articles published in reputable journals in English language were included. Conversely, non-peer-reviewed articles, conference abstracts, and editorials were excluded, along with studies lacking experimental or clinical relevance or those unavailable in full text. Hypoxia exacerbates core pathological features such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) dysregulation, and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. These interlinked mechanisms establish a self-perpetuating cycle of neuronal damage, accelerating disease progression. Addressing hypoxia as a modifiable risk factor offers potential for both prevention and treatment of AD. Exploring hypoxia and the HIF signalling pathway may help counteract the neuropathological and symptomatic effects of neurodegeneration.",

      "abstract": "There has been a recent expansion in our understanding of DNA-sensing mechanisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative and proteostatic stresses, instability and impaired disposal of nucleoids cause the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the mitochondria in several human diseases, as well as in cell culture and animal models. Mitochondrial DNA mislocalized to the cytosol and/or the extracellular compartments can trigger innate immune and inflammation responses by binding DNA-sensing receptors (DSRs). Here, we define the features that make mtDNA highly immunogenic and the mechanisms of its release from the mitochondria into the cytosol and the extracellular compartments. We describe the major DSRs that bind mtDNA such as cyclic guanosine-monophosphate-adenosine-monophosphate synthase (cGAS), Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), NOD-, LRR-, and PYD- domain-containing protein 3 receptor (NLRP3), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), and their downstream signaling cascades. We summarize the key findings, novelties,\u00a0and gaps of mislocalized mtDNA as a driving signal of immune responses in vascular, metabolic, kidney, lung, and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as viral and bacterial infections. Finally, we define common strategies to induce or inhibit mtDNA release and propose challenges to advance the field.",

Neurons have high energy demands; thus, maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population is important for their biological function. Recently, exosomes have been reported to have mitochondrial regulatory potential and antineurodegenerative properties. This review presents the mitochondrial abnormalities in brain cells associated with AD and PD and the potential of exosomes to treat these diseases. Specifically, it recapitulates research on the molecular mechanisms whereby exosomes regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion/fission dynamics, mitochondrial transport, and mitophagy. Furthermore, this review discusses exosome-triggered signaling pathways that regulate nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-dependent mitochondrial antioxidation and hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1-dependent metabolic reprogramming. In summary, this review aims to provide a profound understanding of the regulatory effect of exosomes on mitochondrial function in neurons and to propose exosome-mediated mitochondrial regulation as a promising strategy for AD and PD.",

      "abstract": "Aging is characterized by a gradual decline in physiological functions, with brain aging being a major risk factor for numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Given the brain's high energy demands, maintaining an adequate ATP supply is crucial for its proper function. However, with advancing age, mitochondria dysfunction and a deteriorating energy metabolism lead to reduced overall energy production and impaired mitochondrial quality control (MQC). As a result, promoting healthy aging has become a key focus in contemporary research. This review examines the relationship between energy metabolism and brain aging, highlighting the connection between MQC and energy metabolism, and proposes strategies to delay brain aging by targeting energy metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease that involves genetic and environmental factors, which play an essential role in the pathogenesis of PD. Mesenchymal stem cells release a set of bioactive molecules called \"secretome\" that regulates intercellular communication and cargo transfer in signaling pathways for PD treatment. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of neural-induced human adipose tissue-derived stem cell (NI-hADSC)-conditioned medium (NI-hADSC-CM) and its exosomes (NI-hADSC-Exo) in a rotenone (ROT)-induced model of PD in rats. The NI-hADSC-CM was collected from NI-hADSC after 14 days of neural differentiation, and its NI-hADSC-Exo were isolated using a tangential flow filtration system. ROT (1\u00a0mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered for 28 days to establish a model of PD in rats. The treatment of NI-hADSC-CM or NI-hADSC-Exo was intravenously injected on days 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27. Animal behavioral effects were explored via a rotarod test. After 28 days, histological and western blot analyses were performed to investigate the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregation, and downstream signaling pathways for experimental validation. NI-hADSC-Exo improved the motor balance and coordination skills against ROT toxicity. ROT reproduced the pathological features of PD, such as a decrease in TH-positive dopaminergic neurons and an increase in \u03b1-syn aggregation and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells. NI-hADSC-CM and NI-hADSC-Exo improved the TH expression, decreased the Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble oligomeric p-S129 \u03b1-syn, and influenced the differential reactivity to astrocytes and microglia. Secretome treatment could reverse the ROT-induced damages in the neuronal structural and functional proteins, mitochondrial apoptosis, and caspase cascade. The treatment of NI-hADSC-CM and NI-hADSC-Exo ameliorated the ROT toxicity-induced serine-threonine protein kinase dysregulation and autophagy impairment to clear the aggregated \u03b1-syn. NI-hADSC-CM and NI-hADSC-Exo significantly exerted neuroprotection by decreasing \u03b1-syn toxicity, inhibiting neuroinflammation and apoptosis, restoring autophagic flux properties, and promoting the neuronal function in ROT-injected rats; however, the influence of these treatments on signaling pathways differed slightly between the midbrain and striatum regions. Targeting \u03b1-syn degradation pathways provides a novel strategy to elucidate the beneficial effects of MSC secretome and future safe cell-free treatments for PD.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles of eukaryotic cells that play crucial roles in cell functioning and homeostasis, including ATP generation for cellular energy. Mitochondrial function is associated with several complex diseases and disorders, including cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, neurodegenerative diseases and some cancers. The risk for these diseases and disorders is often associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly the quantitative and qualitative features of the mitochondrial genome. Emerging results implicate mito-nuclear crosstalk as the mechanism by which mtDNA variation affects complex disease outcomes. Experimental approaches are emerging for the targeting of mitochondria as a potential therapeutic for several of these diseases, particularly in the form of mitochondrial transplantation. Current approaches to mitochondrial transplantation generally involve isolating healthy mitochondria from donor cells and introducing them to diseased recipients towards amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction. Using such a protocol, several reports have shown recovery of mitochondrial function and improved disease outcomes post-mitochondrial transplantation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic method for several complex, severe and debilitating diseases. Additionally, the mitochondrial genome can be modified prior to transplantation to target disease-associated site-specific mutations and to reduce the ratio of mutant-to-WT alleles. These promising results may underlie the potential impact of mitochondrial transplantation on mito-nuclear genome interactions in the setting of the disease. Further, we recommend that mitochondrial transplantation experimentation include an assessment of potential impacts on remodelling of the nuclear genome, particularly the nuclear epigenome and transcriptome. Herein, we review these and other triumphs and challenges of mitochondrial transplantation as a potential novel therapeutic for mitochondria-associated diseases.",

      "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a main form of idiopathic tauopathy characterized neuropathologically by subcortical neurofibrillary tangles in neurons, oligodendroglial coiled bodies, and tufted astrocytes, which follow sequential distribution in the human brain. Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be a contributor to many neurodegenerative diseases, but its role in PSP at the cellular level remains incompletely understood. To address this, we performed cell-specific morphometric analysis of mitochondrial markers in post-mortem tissues from motor cortex of PSP patients and non-diseased controls (n\u00a0=\u00a05 each) followed by single-nuclear transcriptomics (n\u00a0=\u00a03 each) to identify changes in genes that regulate mitochondrial function. We treated iCell astrocytes with PSP brain homogenates and isolated viable astrocytes from multiple regions of PSP-affected brains. We found that PSP is characterized by significant mitochondrial changes in neurons and astrocytes at the immunohistochemical level, particularly in complex I, with distinct transcriptomic responses across cell types. Glial cells exhibited upregulation of pathways associated with mitochondrial function. In contrast, excitatory and inhibitory neurons showed downregulation in these pathways, indicating impaired mitochondrial function. Astrocytes derived from different human brain regions express varied levels of GFAP and EAAT1 immunoreactivity. Astrocytic tau pathology in cell culture derived from postmortem PSP brains mirrors that seen in corresponding brain tissue histology. Tau pathology in human astrocyte cell culture is associated with clumps of mitochondria potentially associated with impairment in their neuron supportive function. Our results underscore selective complex I damage and cell-type specific patterns that differentiate PSP from other neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases of the eye such as optic neuritis (ON) are hallmarked by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve degeneration leading to irreversible blindness. Therapeutic interventions enhancing expression or activity of SIRT1, an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase, support, at least in part, survival of RGCs in the face of injury. Herein, we used mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) which recapitulates axonal and neuronal damages characteristic of ON to identify gene regulatory networks affected by constitutive ubiquitous Sirt1 expression in SIRT1 knock-in mice and wild-type mice upon targeted adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated SIRT1 expression in RGCs. RNA seq data analysis showed that the most upregulated genes in EAE mouse retinas include those involved in inflammation, immune response, apoptosis, and mitochondrial turnover. The latter includes genes regulating mitophagy (e.g., Atg4), mitochondrial transport (e.g., Ipo- 6, Xpo- 6), and mitochondrial localization (e.g., Chrna4, Scn9a). The constitutive or RGC-targeted SIRT1 overexpression in EAE mice upregulated the expression of non-mitochondrial genes such as Ecel1 and downregulated the expression of mitophagy genes (e.g., Atg2b, Arifip1) which were upregulated by EAE alone. Thus, SIRT1 induces neuroprotection by, at least in part, balancing mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy and/or enhancing mitochondrial self-repair to preserve the bioenergetic capacity of RGCs.",

      "abstract": "Mutations in the TARDBP gene, which encodes the TDP-43 protein, account for only 3-5% of familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and less than 1% of cases that are apparently idiopathic. However, the discovery of neuronal inclusions of TDP-43 as the neuropathological hallmark in the majority of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has transformed our understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. An individual TARDBP mutation can cause phenotypic heterogeneity. Most mutations lie within the C-terminus of the TDP-43 protein. In pathological conditions, TDP-43 is mislocalised from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it can be phosphorylated, cleaved, and form insoluble aggregates. This mislocalisation leads to dysfunction of downstream pathways of RNA metabolism, proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, axonal transport, and local translation. Biomarkers for TDP-43 dysfunction and targeted therapies are being developed, justifying cautious optimism for personalised medicine approaches that could rescue the downstream effects of TDP-43 pathology.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) represent a rapidly escalating global health challenge, contributing significantly to the worldwide disease burden and posing substantial threats to public health systems across nations. Among the many risk factors for neurodegeneration, aging is the major risk factor. In the context of aging, multiple factors lead to the release of endogenous DNA (especially mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA), which is an important trigger for the activation of the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway. Recent studies have identified an increasing role for activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway as a driver of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) in aging and NDDs. The cGAS-STING pathway mediates the immune sensing of DNA and is a key driver of chronic inflammation and functional decline during the aging process. Blocking cGAS-STING signaling may reduce the inflammatory response by preventing mtDNA release and enhancing mitophagy. Targeted inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway by biological macromolecules such as natural products shows promise in therapeutic strategies for age-related NDDs. This review aims to systematically and comprehensively introduces the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in age-related NDDs in the context of aging while revealing the molecular mechanisms of the cGAS-STING pathway and its downstream signaling pathways and to develop more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies for NDDs.",

Previous work within our laboratory has revealed that Lipin1, a critical enzyme related to phospholipid synthesis, is involved in the pathogenesis of DE. Here, we show that Lipin1 is downregulated within the hippocampus of a DE mouse model, an effect which was accompanied with a decrease in MAMs. Knockdown of Lipin1 in the hippocampus of normal mice resulted in a reduction of MAMs, ER stress, abnormal mitochondrial function, as well as impaired synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. These same phenomena were observed in the DE model, while an upregulation of Lipin1 within the hippocampus of DE mice improved these symptoms. Low levels of Lipin1 in DE mice were also associated with neuroinflammation, while an overexpression of Lipin1 significantly ameliorated the neuroinflammation observed in DE mice. In conclusion, Lipin1 ameliorates pathological changes associated with DE in a mouse model via prevention of dyshomeostasis in MAMs. Such findings suggest that Lipin1 may be serve as a new potential target for the treatment of DE.",

      "abstract": "Lon peptidase 1 (LONP1), a member of the AAA\u2009+\u2009family, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function. Recent studies have revealed that LONP1 serves as a multifunctional enzyme, acting not only as a protease but also as a molecular chaperone, interacting with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and playing roles in mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress, cellular respiration, and energy metabolism. LONP1 is evolutionarily highly conserved, and mutations or dysfunctions in LONP1 can lead to diseases. There is growing evidence linking LONP1 to various human diseases, such as tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and heart diseases. This review discusses the discovery, molecular structure, subcellular localization, tissue distribution, and mitochondrial function of LONP1. Furthermore, it summarizes the associations between LONP1 and tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and heart diseases, exploring its role in different diseases and potential molecular mechanisms. It also analyzes the regulatory effects of related inhibitors and agonists on LONP1. Considering the pleiotropic effects of LONP1, the study of LONP1 is crucial to understanding the relevant pathophysiological processes and developing strategies to modulate and control these related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction associated with neuronal degeneration and subsequent synaptic disconnection are essential for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Considering that astrocytes play key roles in synaptogenesis during development, we hypothesized that fibroblast growth factor - 2 (FGF2), a key factor for astrocyte development, could reverse the toxic phenotype of reactive astrocytes, and the extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from FGF2-primed astrocytes would enhance synaptogenesis in PD model. The present study was to test this hypothesis. EVs isolated from FGF2-primed astrocytes (FGF2-EVs) were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. FGF2-EVs were applied to both in vitro and in vivo models of PD. EVs derived from na\u00efve astrocytes (CON-EV) were used as control. Mitochondrial alterations, neuronal survival, synaptogenesis, and mice behavior were subsequently evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western-blotting, immunohistochemistry, and CatWalk gait analysis. To dissect the underlying mechanisms, proteomic analysis and small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated gene silencing were adopted. FGF2 treatment restored the expression of neural progenitor markers and suppressed the levels of A1 astrocytic markers in MPP<sup>+</sup> pretreated astrocytes. FGF2-EVs, in comparison with that of CON-EVs, effectively protected neurons from mitochondrial fragmentation and stimulated synaptogenesis, as evidenced by expression of Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin (SYP). Proteomic analysis revealed high enrichment of neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) in FGF2-EVs. Knocking down NCAM1 severely influenced the expression of mitochondrial and synaptic proteins. Furthermore, delivery of FGF2-EVs significantly enhanced the survival of TH+ neurons, the levels of NCAM1 and synaptogenesis in the substantia nigra of PD mice, as well as the locomotion of PD mice. EVs from FGF2-primed astrocytes are superior in protecting PD mice against mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities, possibly through NCAM1, which could be used as a therapeutic strategy for PD.",

      "abstract": "Myofibrillar myopathy type 5 (MFM5) is a dominantly inherited myopathy caused by mutations in the FLNC gene. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of MFM5 remain unclear, and there are currently no effective treatments available. This study hypothesizes that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of MFM5, on the basis of the COX-negative fibres observed in MFM5 patients. To test this hypothesis, a zebrafish model was developed to explore the impact of filamin-C on mitochondrial dynamics. These results demonstrated that defects in filamin-C disrupt mitochondrial fission, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy. This hypothesis was further validated through the analysis of skeletal muscle samples from MFM5 patients. These findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction caused by imbalanced fission and fusion of mitochondria and mitophagy contributes to MFM5 pathology. Importantly, this study identified potential therapeutic targets for MFM5 treatment, opening avenues for future research aimed at developing targeted interventions.",

      "abstract": "We have previously shown that the compound CGP37157, a mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger inhibitor, increases lifespan and improves muscle and mitochondrial structure during aging in wild-type <i>C. elegans</i> nematodes. We used here a rotenone model of Parkinson's disease in <i>C. elegans</i> to test the ability of CGP37157 to rescue the alterations induced by the toxicant. Rotenone, a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I inhibitor, reduced worm lifespan and muscle activity, measured as worm mobility, pharyngeal pumping, and defecation rate. It also increased ROS production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and disorganized mitochondrial structure. Moreover, it induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and changes in behavior. We found that CGP37157 produced a partial or complete reversal of most of these alterations. These results are consistent with our previous proposal that Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is important in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, and modulation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling toolkit may be a novel target for their treatment.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, demonstrates the critical involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in its pathogenesis. This review comprehensively examines the role and molecular mechanisms of ERS in PD. ERS represents a cellular stress response triggered by imbalances in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, induced by factors such as hypoxia and misfolded protein aggregation, which activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) through the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathways. Clinical, animal model, and cellular studies have consistently demonstrated a strong association between PD and ERS. Abnormal expression of ERS-related molecules in PD patients' brains and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) correlates with disease progression. In animal models (e.g., Drosophila and mice), ERS inhibition alleviates dopaminergic neuronal damage. Cellular experiments reveal that PD-mimicking pathological conditions induce ERS, while interactions between ERS and mitochondrial dysfunction promote neuronal apoptosis. Mechanistically, (1) pathological aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) and ERS mutually reinforce dopaminergic neuron damage; (2) leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene mutations induce ERS through thrombospondin-1 (THBS1)/transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) interactions; (3) molecules such as Parkin and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) regulate ERS in PD. Furthermore, ERS interacts with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation to exacerbate neuronal injury. Emerging therapeutic strategies show significant potential, including artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted drug design targeting ERS pathways and precision medicine approaches exploring non-pharmacological interventions such as personalized electroacupuncture. Future research should focus on elucidating ERS-related mechanisms and identifying novel therapeutic targets to develop more effective treatments for PD patients, ultimately improving their quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Emerging small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), including tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs), are critical in various biological processes, such as neurological diseases. Traditional sncRNA-sequencing (seq) protocols often miss these sncRNAs due to their modifications, such as internal and terminal modifications, that can interfere with sequencing. We recently developed panoramic RNA display by overcoming RNA modification aborted sequencing (PANDORA-seq), a method enabling comprehensive detection of modified sncRNAs by overcoming the RNA modifications. Using PANDORA-seq, we revealed a previously unrecognized sncRNA profile enriched by tsRNAs/rsRNAs in the mouse prefrontal cortex and found a significant downregulation of mitochondrial tsRNAs and rsRNAs in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model compared to wild-type controls, while this pattern is not present in the genomic tsRNAs and rsRNAs. Moreover, our integrated analysis of gene expression and sncRNA profiles reveals that those downregulated mitochondrial sncRNAs negatively correlate with enhanced lysosomal activity, suggesting a crucial interplay between mitochondrial RNA dynamics and lysosomal function in AD. Given the versatile tsRNA/tsRNA molecular actions in cellular regulation, our data provide insights for future mechanistic study of AD with potential therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective cell vulnerability, particularly affecting cerebellar anterior Purkinje neurons. These neurons exhibit a distinctive pattern of degeneration due to the loss of NPC1 and/or NPC2 protein function, progressively extending towards posterior cerebellar regions. Our study aimed to explore the early factors influencing this selective vulnerability of anterior Purkinje neurons in NPC. Oxytosis/ferroptosis, a novel form of regulated cell death, has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, with its inhibition showing promising therapeutic potential. Our laboratory has previously identified parallels between NPC cellular pathology and ferroptotic markers, including elevated levels of lipid peroxidation and iron, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyshomeostasis. However, whether oxytosis/ferroptosis underlies NPC cellular pathology remains unexplored. We hypothesize that loss of NPC1 function increases vulnerability to ferroptosis and that anti-ferroptotic compounds will reverse NPC cellular pathology. Through bioinformatic analyses of pre-symptomatic <i>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></i> Purkinje neurons and in vitro studies using primary dermal fibroblasts derived from NPC patients, we provide evidence suggesting that oxytosis/ferroptosis may play a pathogenic role in NPC. These findings highlight the potential of anti-ferroptotic compounds as a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate neurodegeneration in NPC and potentially other related disorders.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and several common neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as instrumental variables (IVs). After screening for relevance and potential confounders, we estimated the association between mtDNA copy number and NDs, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple sclerosis (MS). Additionally, we validated our findings using GWAS data on mtDNA copy number from Longchamps et al., sourced from the Genetics Epidemiology Consortium and the UK Biobank (UKB) aging study cohort. A GWAS analysis of 395,718 UKB participants found no significant association between mtDNA copy number and the risk of NDs, including AD (OR\u2009=\u20090.956, P\u2009=\u20090.708), PD (OR\u2009=\u20091.223, P\u2009=\u20090.179), ALS (OR\u2009=\u20090.972, P\u2009=\u20090.374), and MS (OR\u2009=\u20090.932, P\u2009=\u20090.789). Similarly, reverse MR analysis revealed no significant relationship between genetic predictions of NDs and mtDNA copy number: AD (OR\u2009=\u20090.987, P\u2009=\u20090.062), PD (OR\u2009=\u20090.997, P\u2009=\u20090.514), ALS (OR\u2009=\u20090.974, P\u2009=\u20090.706), and MS (OR\u2009=\u20091.003, P\u2009=\u20090.181). Although mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of NDs, no clear evidence supports a causal role for mtDNA copy number. The relationship between mtDNA copy number and NDs is likely mediated by more complex molecular regulatory mechanisms. Further research is required to elucidate these intricate interactions.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease, which is often treated with obvious side effects such as dopamine replacement therapy. Our team has validated the unique advantages of the traditional Chinese medicine formula, YiQiWenYangSanHan formula (YQWYSHF), through in vitro experiments, confirming its therapeutic potential for PD. Nevertheless, further research and validation are required to fully understand its protective effects and underlying mechanisms against PD. This study employed an in vivo model to investigate the effects of YQWYSHF on motor impairments, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in C57BL/6\u202fJ mice caused by MPTP. Sixty C57BL/6\u202fJ mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, all groups except the control group were intraperitoneally administered MPTP for 7 days (30\u202fmg/kg). After 4 weeks of drug intragastric treatment, we assessed the dyskinesia of mice treated with different doses of YQWYSHF by behavioral examination. Additionally, immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression of ionized calcium binding adaptor protein 1 (IBA1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP) cells. Western blotting was used to assess the expression level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), pyrin domain-containing 3 protein (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like proteins (ASC), cysteine-containing aspartate protease-1 (Caspase-1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), and poly ADP ribose (PAR). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial impairment in the neuronal cells of the substantia nigra (SN). YQWYSHF treatment alleviated dyskinesia in a mouse model of PD. Moreover, it increased the TH expression, and could reverse the increase of IBA1, GFAP, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1,IL-1\u03b2, \u03b1-syn, PARP1 and PAR proteins induced by MPTP. YQWYSHF protects dopaminergic neurons in PD by attenuating neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. This study provides new evidence for the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of PD.",

      "abstract": "Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a naturally occurring redox-active compound with potent antioxidant, mitochondrial-enhancing, and neuroprotective properties. Originally identified as a cofactor in bacterial enzymes, PQQ has garnered significant interest for its potential therapeutic role in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). It has reported that PQQ exerts its effects through several key molecular mechanisms, including the activation of antioxidant pathways via Nrf2/ARE signaling, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and function through AMPK/PGC-1\u03b1, and the regulation of inflammatory processes through NF-\u03baB inhibition. By improving cellular energy metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting neuronal survival, PQQ offers a multifaceted approach to counteracting the pathophysiological factors underlying neurodegeneration. Our review focusing on current study of PQQ on its enhancing neuroplasticity, and protecting neurons from damage induced by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. Further we reviewed the significant signaling pathways that involved PQQ neuroprotective mechanisms, positioning it as a novel candidate for future therapeutic strategies targeting these debilitating conditions.",

      "title": "The role of Panax ginseng in neurodegenerative disorders: mechanisms, benefits, and future directions.",
      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Multiple sclerosis (MS), and Huntington's disease (HD) represent a growing global health challenge, especially with aging populations. Characterized by progressive neuronal loss, these diseases lead to cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Current therapies largely address symptoms without halting disease progression, underscoring the need for innovative, disease-modifying treatments. Ginseng, a traditional herbal medicine with well-known adaptogenic and neuroprotective properties, has gained attention as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegeneration. Rich in bioactive compounds called ginsenosides, ginseng exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, making it a promising candidate for addressing the complex pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies demonstrate that ginsenosides modulate disease-related processes such as oxidative stress, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. In AD models, ginsenosides have been shown to reduce amyloid-beta accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, while in PD, they help protect dopaminergic neurons and mitigate motor symptoms. Ginseng's effects in ALS, MS, and HD models include improving motor function, extending neuronal survival, and reducing cellular toxicity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the neuroprotective mechanisms of ginseng, emphasizing its therapeutic potential across various neurodegenerative diseases and discussing future research directions for its integration into clinical practice.",

      "title": "Relationship between Alzheimer's Disease and Type 2 Diabetes: Critical Review On Cellular and Molecular Common Pathogenic Mechanisms.",
      "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are two diseases with a high prevalence today that share common pathophysiological mechanisms, suggesting a potential causal relationship between them. AD is also known as Type 3 Diabetes Mellitus (T3D). A complete understanding of this complex issue (T2D-AD) is necessary to develop fully effective and easily applicable therapies that do not yet exist. A critical update on the subject is presented, delving into the pathophysiological implications and defining new research for promoting new therapeutic interventions. Revision and critical analysis of the described and observed cellular and molecular common pathogenic T2D-AD mechanisms in human and model studies. Both diseases exhibit common genetic, epigenetic, biochemical and physiological characteristics. Pathogenic mechanisms such as peripheral inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, formation of advanced glycation end products, neuroinflammation, neuroglial dysfunctions, and deposition of aberrant misfolded proteins are commonly displayed in dysmetabolic diseases and AD. The T2D, AD and T2D-AD pathogenic courses present several close key contacts (or identities). The clinical course of T2D has different incidences in the neurodegenerative course of AD (from its onset to its aggravation). There are theoretical, practical and interpretative problems in studies on human and experimental models, as well as in the clinical and pathological interpretation of T2D-AD dementia, which are of great importance in the development of knowledge of this subject and the therapeutic application of its results. In recent years, there has been a great advance in the study of the relationships between T2D (and related dysmetabolic diseases) and AD. There is no doubt about their close relationship and/or the inclusion of AD as a metabolic disease (T3D). Joint therapies seem to be absolutely necessary. Key pathogenic processes (insulin resistance, genetic and epigenetic regulation, peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation) must be investigated to develop new and effective therapies.",
